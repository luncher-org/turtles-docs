If you have been using previous versions of Turtles and are upgrading to v0.9.0, we recommend you take a look at the migration mechanisms and their implications: Automatic migration. Manual migration Rancher Turtles is a Kubernetes Operator that provides integration between Rancher Manager and Cluster API (CAPI) with the aim of bringing full CAPI support to Rancher. With Rancher Turtles, you can: Automatically import CAPI clusters into Rancher, by installing the Rancher Cluster Agent in CAPI provisioned clusters. Configure the CAPI Operator.

Submitting PRs Choosing something to work on Developing rancher-turtles Asking for help PR submission guidelines Commit message formatting Opening Issues How the Maintainers process contributions Prioritizing issues Reviewing PRs ADRs (Architectural Decision Records) Process Thank you for taking the time to contribute to Rancher CAPI extension projects. Improvements to all areas of the project; from code, to documentation; from bug reports to feature design and UI enhancement are gratefully welcome. This guide should cover all aspects of how to interact with the project and how to get involved in development as smoothly as possible. Reading docs is often tedious, so let’s put the important contributing rule right at the top: Always be kind! Looking forward to seeing your contributions in the repo! We’d love to accept your patches in pretty much all areas of projects development! If you’re a new to the project and want to help, but don’t know where to start, here is a non-exhaustive list of ways you can help out: Submit a Pull Request Beyond fixing bugs and submitting new features, there are other things you can submit which, while less flashy, will be deeply appreciated by all who interact with the codebase: Extending test coverage! Refactoring! Reviewing and updating documentation! Adding a new UI functionality! (See also Choosing something to work on below.) Open an issue We have 2 forms of issues: bug reports and feature requests. If you are not sure which category you need, just make the best guess and provide as much information as possible. Interested in helping to improve: Rancher CAPI extension backend? Chime in on bugs or help wanted issues. If you are seeking to take on a bigger challenge or a more experienced contributor, check out feature requests. extension UI? Take a look at open or help wanted issues. maybe, user-docs? Then, jump straight into open issues in the docs repository. These guides aim to help you write issues in a way which will ensure that they are processed as quickly as possible. See below for how issues are prioritized. General rules: Before opening anything, take a good look through existing issues. More is more: give as much information as it is humanly possible to give. Highly detailed issues are more likely to be picked up because they can be prioritized and scheduled for work faster. They are also more accessible to the community, meaning that you may not have to wait for the core team to get to it. Please do not open an issue with a description that is just a link to another issue, a link to a slack conversation, a quote from either one of those, or anything else equally opaque. This raises the bar for entry and makes it hard for the community to get involved. Take the time to write a proper description and summarise key points. Take care with formatting. Ensure the markdown is tidy, use code blocks etc etc. The faster something can be read, the faster it can be dealt with. Keep it civil. Yes, it is annoying when things don’t work, but it is way more fun helping out someone who is not…​ the worst. Remember that conversing via text exacerbates everyone’s negativity bias, so throw in some emoji when in doubt. If you are here to ask for help or request some new behaviour, this is the section for you. We have curated a set of issues for anyone who simply wants to build up their open-source cred. Issues labelled good first issues should be accessible to folks new to the repos, as well as to open source in general. These issues should present a low/non-existent barrier to entry with a thorough description, easy-to-follow reproduction (if relevant) and enough context for anyone to pick up. The objective should be clear, possibly with a suggested solution or some pseudocode. If anything similar has been done, that work should be linked. If you have come across an issue tagged with good first issue which you think you would like to claim but isn’t 100% clear, please ask for more info! When people write issues there is a lot of assumed knowledge which is very often taken for granted. This is something we could all get better at, so don’t be shy in asking for what you need to do great work. See more on asking for help below! help wanted issues are for those a little more familiar with the code base, but should still be accessible enough to newcomers. All other issues labelled kind/<x> or area/<x> are also up for grabs, but are likely to require a fair amount of context. Check out the dedicated notes on getting started with development. If you need help at any stage of your work, please don’t hesitate to ask! To get more detail on the issue you have chosen, it is a good idea to start by asking whoever created it to provide more information. If you are struggling with something while working on your PR, or aren’t quite sure of your approach, you can open a draft (prefix the title with WIP:) and explain what you are thinking. Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes. Push your changes to the branch on your fork and submit a pull request to the original repository against the main branch. git push <remote-name> <feature-name> Submit a pull request. All code PR must be labeled with one of ⚠️ (:warning:, major or breaking changes) ✨ (:sparkles:, feature additions) 🐛 (:bug:, patch and bugfixes) 📖 (:book:, documentation or proposals) 🌱 (:seedling:, minor or other) Where possible, please squash your commits to ensure a tidy and descriptive history. If your PR is still a work in progress, please open a Draft PR and prefix your title with the word WIP. When your PR is ready for review, you can change the title and remove the Draft setting. We recommend that you regularly rebase from main of the original repo to keep your branch up to date. In general, we will merge a PR once a maintainer has reviewed and approved it. Trivial changes (e.g., corrections to spelling) may get waved through. For substantial changes, more people may become involved, and you might get asked to resubmit the PR or divide the changes into more than one PR. For more on how to write great commit messages, and why you should, check out this excellent blog post. We follow a rough convention for commit messages that is designed to answer three questions: what changed, why was the change made, and how did you make it. The subject line should feature the what and the body of the commit should describe the why and how. If you encountered any weirdness along the way, this is a good place to note what you discovered and how you solved it. The format can be described more formally as follows: <short title for what changed> <BLANK LINE> <why this change was made and what changed> <BLANK LINE> <any interesting details> <footer> The first line is the subject and should be no longer than 70 characters, the second line is always blank, and other lines should be wrapped at a max of 80 characters. This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools. There is a template recommend for use here. The core team regularly processes incoming issues. There may be some delay over holiday periods. Every issue will be assigned a priority/<x> label. The levels of priorities are: critical-urgent: These are time sensitive issues which should be picked up immediately. If an issue labelled critical is not assigned or being actively worked on, someone is expected to drop what they’re doing immediately to work on it. This usually means the core team, but community members are welcome to claim issues at any priority level if they get there first. However, given the pressing timeframe, should a non-core contributor request to be assigned to a critical issue, they will be paired with a core team-member to manage the tracking, communication and release of any fix as well as to assume responsibility of all progess. important-soon: Must be assigned as soon as capacity becomes available. Ideally something should be delivered in time for the next release. important-longterm: Important over the long term, but may not be currently staffed and/or may require multiple releases to complete. backlog: There appears to be general agreement that this would be good to have, but we may not have anyone available to work on it right now or in the immediate future. PRs are still very welcome, although it might take a while to get them reviewed if reviewers are fully occupied with higher priority issues, for example immediately before a release. These priority categories have been inspired by the Kubernetes contributing guide. Other labels include: adr-required: Indicates that the issue or PR contains a decision that needs to be documented in a ADR before it can be worked on. needs-investigation: There is currently insufficient information to either categorize properly, or to understand and implement a solution. This could be because the issue opener did not provide enough relevant information, or because more in-depth research is required before work can begin. The core team aims to clear the PR queue as quickly as possible. Community members should also feel free to keep an eye on things and provide their own thoughts and expertise. High-value and/or high priority contributions will be processed as quickly as possible, while lower priority or nice-to-have things may take a little longer to get approved. To help facilitate a smoother and faster review, follow the guidelines above. Submissions which do not meet standards will be de-prioritised for review. Please feel free to skip this and sub-section below, since they are only relevant to the rancher-turtles repository. Any impactful decisions to the architecture, design, development and behaviour of rancher-turtles must be recorded in the form of an ADR. A template can be found at docs/adr/0000-template.md of the repo, with numerous examples of completed records in the same directory. Contributors are also welcome to backfill ADRs if they are found to be missing. Start a new discussion using the ADR category. Choose an appropriate clear and concise title (e.g. ADR: Implement X in Go). Provide a context of the decision to be made. Describe the various options, if more than one, and explain the pros and cons. Highlight any areas which you would like the reviewers to pay attention to, or those on which you would specifically like an opinion. Tag in the maintainers as the \"Deciders\", and invite them to participate and weigh in on the decision and its consequences. Once a decision has been made, open a PR adding a new ADR to the directory.

This section describes how to install Cluster API Operator in the Kubernetes cluster. CAPI and desired CAPI providers could be installed using the helm-based installation for Cluster API Operator or as a helm dependency for the Rancher Turtles. To install Cluster API Operator with version 1.9.4 of the CAPI + Docker provider using helm, follow these steps: Add the Helm repository for the Cluster API Operator: helm repo add capi-operator https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/cluster-api-operator helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io Update the Helm repository: helm repo update Install the Cert-Manager: helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --namespace cert-manager --create-namespace --set installCRDs=true Install the Cluster API Operator: helm install capi-operator capi-operator/cluster-api-operator \\ --create-namespace -n capi-operator-system \\ --set infrastructure=docker:v1.9.4 \\ --set core=cluster-api:v1.9.4 \\ --timeout 90s --wait # Core Cluster API with kubeadm bootstrap and control plane providers will also be installed cert-manager is a hard requirement for CAPI and Cluster API Operator* To provide additional environment variables, enable feature gates, or supply cloud credentials, similar to clusterctl common provider, variables secret with name and a namespace of the secret could be specified for the Cluster API Operator as shown below. helm install capi-operator capi-operator/cluster-api-operator \\ --create-namespace -n capi-operator-system \\ --set infrastructure=docker:v1.9.4 \\ --set core=cluster-api:v1.9.4 \\ --timeout 90s \\ --secret-name <secret_name> \\ --wait Example secret data: apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: variables namespace: default type: Opaque stringData: CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY: \"true\" EXP_CLUSTER_RESOURCE_SET: \"true\" To select more than one desired provider to be installed together with the Cluster API Operator, the --infrastructure flag can be specified with multiple provider names separated by a comma. For example: helm install ... --set infrastructure=\"docker:v1.9.4;aws:v2.7.1\" The infrastructure flag is set to docker:v1.9.4;aws:v2.7.1, representing the desired provider names. This means that the Cluster API Operator will install and manage multiple providers, Docker and AWS, with versions v1.9.4 and v2.7.1 respectively. The cluster is now ready to install Rancher Turtles. The default behavior when installing the chart is to install Cluster API Operator as a Helm dependency. Since we decided to install it manually before installing Rancher Turtles, the feature cluster-api-operator.enabled must be explicitly disabled as otherwise it would conflict with the existing installation. You can refer to Install Rancher Turtles without Cluster API Operator to see next steps. For more fine-grained control of the providers and other components installed with CAPI, see the Add the infrastructure provider section. This option is only suitable for development purposes and not recommended for production environments. The rancher-turtles chart is available in https://rancher.github.io/turtles and this Helm repository must be added before proceeding with the installation: helm repo add turtles https://rancher.github.io/turtles helm repo update and then it can be installed into the rancher-turtles-system namespace with: helm install rancher-turtles turtles/rancher-turtles --version v0.16.0 \\ -n rancher-turtles-system \\ --set cluster-api-operator.enabled=false \\ --set cluster-api-operator.cluster-api.enabled=false \\ --create-namespace --wait \\ --dependency-update As you can see, we are telling Helm to ignore installing cluster-api-operator as a dependency.

To provision and configure Cluster API providers, Turtles uses the CAPIProvider resource to allow managing Cluster API Operator manifests in a declarative way. Every field provided by the upstream CAPI Operator resource for the desired spec.type is also available in the spec of the CAPIProvider resouce. To install Cluster API providers in an air-gapped environment the following will need to be done: Configure the Cluster API Operator for an air-gapped environment: The operator chart will be fetched and stored as a part of the Turtles chart. Provide image overrides for the operator from an accessible image repository. Configure Cluster API providers for an air-gapped environment: Provide fetch configuration for each provider from an accessible location (e.g., an internal github/gitlab server) or from pre-created ConfigMaps within the cluster. Provide image overrides for each provider to pull images from an accessible image repository. Configure Rancher Turtles for an air-gapped environment: Collect and publish Rancher Turtles images and publish to the private registry. Example of cert-manager installation for the reference. Provide fetch configuration and image values for core and caprke2 providers in values.yaml. Provider image value for the Cluster API Operator helm chart dependency in values.yaml. Image values specified with the cluster-api-operator key will be passed along to the Cluster API Operator. As an admin, I need to fetch the vSphere provider (CAPV) components from within the cluster because I am working in an air-gapped environment. In this example, there is a ConfigMap in the capv-system namespace that defines the components and metadata of the provider. It can be created manually or by running the following commands: # Get the file contents from the GitHub release curl -L https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/cluster-api-provider-vsphere/releases/download/v1.11.2/infrastructure-components.yaml -o components.yaml curl -L https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/cluster-api-provider-vsphere/releases/download/v1.11.2/metadata.yaml -o metadata.yaml # Create the configmap from the files kubectl create configmap v1.11.2 --namespace=capv-system --from-file=components=components.yaml --from-file=metadata=metadata.yaml --dry-run=client -o yaml > configmap.yaml This command example would need to be adapted to the provider and version you want to use. The resulting config map will look similar to the example below: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: labels: provider-components: vsphere name: v1.11.2 namespace: capv-system data: components: | # Components for v1.11.2 YAML go here metadata: | # Metadata information goes here A CAPIProvider resource will need to be created to represent the vSphere infrastructure provider. It will need to be configured with a fetchConfig. The label selector allows the operator to determine the available versions of the vSphere provider and the Kubernetes resources that need to be deployed (i.e. contained within ConfigMaps which match the label selector). Since the provider’s version is marked as v1.11.2, the operator uses the components information from the ConfigMap with matching label to install the vSphere provider. apiVersion: turtles-capi.cattle.io/v1alpha1 kind: CAPIProvider metadata: name: vsphere namespace: capv-system spec: name: vsphere type: infrastructure version: v1.11.2 configSecret: name: vsphere-variables fetchConfig: selector: matchLabels: provider-components: vsphere deployment: containers: - name: manager imageUrl: \"registry.suse.com/rancher/cluster-api-vsphere-controller:v1.11.2\" variables: CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY: \"true\" EXP_CLUSTER_RESOURCE_SET: \"true\" EXP_MACHINE_POOL: \"true\" Additionally the CAPIProvider overrides the container image to use for the provider using the deployment.containers[].imageUrl field. This allows the operator to pull the image from a registry within the air-gapped environment. There is a limit on the maximum size of a ConfigMap - 1MiB. If the manifests do not fit into this size, Kubernetes will generate an error and provider installation fail. To avoid this, you can archive the manifests and put them in the ConfigMap that way. For example, you have two files: components.yaml and metadata.yaml. To create a working config map you need: Archive components.yaml using gzip cli tool gzip -c components.yaml > components.gz Create a ConfigMap manifest from the archived data kubectl create configmap v1.11.2 --namespace=capv-system --from-file=components=components.gz --from-file=metadata=metadata.yaml --dry-run=client -o yaml > configmap.yaml Edit the file by adding \"provider.cluster.x-k8s.io/compressed: true\" annotation yq eval -i '.metadata.annotations += {\"provider.cluster.x-k8s.io/compressed\": \"true\"}' configmap.yaml without this annotation operator won’t be able to determine if the data is compressed or not. Add labels that will be used to match the ConfigMap in fetchConfig section of the provider yq eval -i '.metadata.labels += {\"my-label\": \"label-value\"}' configmap.yaml Create a ConfigMap in your kubernetes cluster using kubectl kubectl create -f configmap.yaml","title":"Air-gapped environment","component":"turtles","version":"v0.16","name":"air-gapped-environment","url":"/turtles/stable/en/getting-started/air-gapped-environment.html","titles":[{"text":"Example Usage","hash":"_example_usage","id":1},{"text":"Situation when manifests do not fit into ConfigMap","hash":"_situation_when_manifests_do_not_fit_into_configmap","id":2}]},"8":{"id":8,"text":"If you’re already running Rancher, you can skip this section and jump to Install Rancher Turtles.

See core provider Or Cluster API Operator project The Cluster API Operator is a sub-project of the SIG-cluster-lifecycle. It is designed to empower cluster administrators to handle the lifecycle of Cluster API providers within a management cluster using a declarative approach. Cluster API Provider RKE2 is a combination of two provider types: a Cluster API Control Plane Provider for provisioning Kubernetes control plane nodes and a Cluster API Bootstrap Provider for bootstrapping Kubernetes on a machine where RKE2 is used as the Kubernetes distro. The set of Kubernetes services that form the basis of a cluster. See also https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/#_kubernetes-control-plane There are two variants: Self-provisioned: A Kubernetes control plane consisting of pods or machines wholly managed by a single Cluster API deployment. External or Managed: A control plane offered and controlled by some system other than Cluster API (e.g., GKE, AKS, EKS, IKS). Refers to a provider that implements a solution for the management of a Kubernetes control plane. See CAPRRKE2, KCP. Refers to a provider that implements Cluster API core controllers; if you consider that the first project that must be deployed in a management Cluster is Cluster API itself, it should be clear why the Cluster API project is also referred to as the core provider. See CAPI. A container management and deployment engine designed to offer users more control on the local cluster and constant monitoring through GitOps. Take a look at fleet documentation to know more about Fleet. Refers to a provider that implements provisioning of infrastructure/computational resources required by the Cluster or by Machines (e.g. VMs, networking, etc.). Clouds infrastructure providers include AWS, Azure, or Google; while VMware, MAAS, or metal3.io can be defined as bare metal providers. Refers to a provider that allows Cluster API to interact with IPAM solutions. IPAM provider’s interaction with Cluster API is based on the IPAddressClaim and IPAddress API types.

Kubeadm Control plane Provider Or Machine Resource The Custom Resource for Kubernetes that represents an infrastructure component that hosts a Kubernetes node. Perform create, scale, upgrade, or destroy operations on the cluster. Managed Kubernetes refers to any Kubernetes cluster provisioning and maintenance abstraction, usually exposed as an API, that is natively available in a Cloud provider. For example: EKS, OKE, AKS, GKE, IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, DOKS, and many more throughout the Kubernetes Cloud Native ecosystem. See Topology The cluster where one or more Infrastructure Providers run, and where resources (e.g. Machines) are stored. Typically referred to when you are provisioning multiple workload clusters. A node pool is a group of nodes within a cluster that all have the same configuration. Or OS A generically understood combination of a kernel and system-level userspace interface, such as Linux or Windows, as opposed to a particular distribution. Pivot is a process for moving the provider components and declared cluster-api resources from a Source Management cluster to a Target Management cluster. The pivot process is also used for deleting a management cluster and could also be used during an upgrade of the management cluster. Or Cluster API provider This term was originally used as abbreviation for Infrastructure provider, but currently it is used to refer to any project that can be deployed and provides functionality to the Cluster API management Cluster. See Bootstrap provider, Control plane provider, Core provider, Infrastructure provider, IPAM provider, Runtime extension provider. Refers to the YAML artifact published as part of the release process for providers; it usually includes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), Deployments (to run the controller manager), RBAC, etc. In some cases, the same expression is used to refer to the instances of above components deployed in a management cluster. See Provider repository Refers to the location where the YAML for provider components are hosted; usually a provider repository hosts many version of provider components, one for each released version. An open-source platform designed to simplify the deployment and management of Kubernetes clusters. A component deployed by Rancher in each Kubernetes cluster it manages. Its primary role is to establish a secure communication channel between the Rancher server and the Kubernetes cluster, enabling Rancher to manage and interact with the cluster. The Rancher Manager (or Rancher Server) is where the Rancher UI and API are hosted, and it communicates with managed clusters through components like the Rancher Cluster Agent. It allows users to manage their Kubernetes clusters, applications, and Rancher-specific resources such as Catalogs, Users, Global Roles, and more. Rancher’s next-generation, fully conformant Kubernetes distribution that focuses on security and compliance within the U.S. Federal Government sector. See documentation for more details.

A Kubernetes operator that provides integration between Rancher Manager and Cluster API (CAPI) with the aim of bringing full CAPI support to Rancher. A field in the Cluster object spec that allows defining and managing the shape of the Cluster’s control plane and worker machines from a single point of control. The Cluster’s topology is based on a ClusterClass. Sometimes it is also referred as a managed topology. See ClusterClass Refers to Rancher Turtles A cluster created by a ClusterAPI controller, which is not a bootstrap cluster, and is meant to be used by end-users, as opposed to by CAPI tooling. A collection of templates that define a set of worker nodes in the cluster. A ClusterClass contains zero or more WorkerClass definitions.

The specification set by SLSA is useful for both software producers and consumers: producers can follow SLSA’s guidelines to make their software supply chain more secure, and consumers can use SLSA to make decisions about whether to trust a software package. Rancher Turtles meets SLSA Level 3 requirements. Requirement Required at SLSA L3 Met by Rancher Turtles Choose an appropriate build platform Yes Yes Follow a consistent build process Yes Yes Distribute provenance Yes Yes The Rancher Turtles project uses Git for source code management. All the Rancher Turtles maintainers are required to have two-factor authentication enabled, to sign and sign off on all their contributions. The Rancher Turtles project uses GitHub Actions and GitHub Runners for building all its release artifacts. The build and release process runs in isolation on an ephemeral environment provided by GitHub-hosted runners. The build and release process is defined in code and is kept under version control. The GitHub Workflows make use of GitHub Actions pinned to certain versions and are kept up-to-date using GitHub Dependabot. All changes to the build and release process are done via Pull Requests that must be approved by at least one Rancher Turtles maintainer. The release process can only be kicked off by a Rancher Turtles maintainer by pushing a Git tag in the semver format. The Rancher Turtles project uses the official SLSA GitHub Generator project for provenance generation and distribution. The provenance for the release artifacts published to GitHub Container Registry and to Rancher Prime Registry is generated using the generator_container_slsa3 GitHub Workflow provided by the SLSA GitHub Generator project. The provenance identifies the Rancher Turtles container images using their digest in SHA-256 format. The provenance is signed by Sigstore Cosign using the GitHub OIDC identity, and the public key to verify the provenance is stored in the public Rekor transparency log. The release process and the provenance generation are run in isolation on an ephemeral environment provided by GitHub-hosted runners. The provenance of the Rancher Turtles container images can be verified using the official SLSA verifier tool. The provenance generation workflows run on ephemeral and isolated virtual machines, which are fully managed by GitHub. The provenance signing secrets are ephemeral and are generated through Sigstore’s keyless signing procedure. The SLSA GitHub Generator runs on separate virtual machines than the build and release process, so that the Rancher Turtles build scripts don’t have access to the signing secrets. The release process and the provenance generation are run in isolation on an ephemeral environment provided by GitHub-hosted runners. The provenance generation is decoupled from the build process; the SLSA GitHub Generator runs on separate virtual machines fully managed by GitHub. The release process can’t access the provenance signing key because the provenance generator runs in isolation on separate GitHub-hosted runners.","title":"SLSA","component":"turtles","version":"v0.16","name":"slsa","url":"/turtles/stable/en/security/slsa.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Build Platform","hash":"_build_platform","id":2},{"text":"Build Process","hash":"_build_process","id":3},{"text":"Provenance","hash":"_provenance","id":4},{"text":"Isolation","hash":"_isolation","id":5}]},"14":{"id":14,"text":"In this section we cover additional operation tasks.","title":"Introduction","component":"turtles","version":"v0.16","name":"intro","url":"/turtles/stable/en/tasks/intro.html","titles":[]},"15":{"id":15,"text":"(github-actions[bot]) released this 2023-10-03 10:02:01 +0000 UTC - v0.1.0 Cluster API enables managing clusters provisioning in a declarative GitOps-friendly approach, allowing users to manage efficiently huge numbers of rancher clusters through a standardised interface. Additionally, users can leverage the upstream CAPI ecosystem and benefit from the many existing infrastructure providers that enable users to provision clusters on many infrastructure provider targets. Cluster API is released as an Extension for Rancher, allowing that traditional provisioning and cluster-api can be used side by side. That makes it a great fit not just for greenfield projects, as well existing rancher manager users can benefit. Ranchers Cluster API extension is initially released as part of our early adopter program, enabling close collaboration with our customers, shaping jointly a mature solution that is battle proven. We are aiming to bring early Q1 Cluster API into GA and production support. If you are interested in joining our Early Adopter Program for Cluster API , don't hesitate to reach out. If you want to get your hands wet, take a look at our documentation and give it a try. If you are stuck, have question or feedback, please ping us in the Rancher Users #cluster-api slack channel. ✨ Install CAPI using operator after chart is installed by @alexander-demicev in #109 Run

v0.16.0 This release of Rancher Turtles focuses on: Updating Cluster API (CAPI) to v1.9+ . Enhancing the build process by introducing cross-compilation to build multi-architecture images. Fixing bugs and adding minor enhancements related to the experimental feature etcd snapshot and restore, Helm chart deprecated values, and support to use CA certificates stored in Rancher to import clusters using the agent TLS settings. All imported CAPI clusters are now represented by the v3 clusters.management.cattle.io resource (if clusters were imported before this change was introduced, they're now automatically migrated). This completes the migration described in ADR 10. Boosting the development process: streamlining Tilt configuration, and adding more tests while also optimizing the test environment setup. General cleanup: Removing deprecated features and updating various dependencies. Addon Provider Fleet is now enabled by default: you can use Fleet to manage CAPI clusters.

ClusterClass is an experimental feature of Cluster API. As with any experimental features it should be used with caution as it may be unreliable. All experimental features are not subject to any compatibility or deprecation promise. It is planned to be graduated with CAPI v1.9. Before using ClusterClass, study the provider docs and confirm that the feature is supported. This documentation includes a matrix in the Certified providers section with cluster topology support status. To use ClusterClass it needs to be enabled for core Cluster API and any provider that supports it. This is done by setting the CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY variable to true. The Rancher Turtles Helm chart will automatically enable the feature when installing CAPI. However, when enabling additional providers, ensure CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY is set in the provider configuration. Turtles' CAPIProvider resource supports passing installation parameters to the provider via variables as follows: apiVersion: turtles-capi.cattle.io/v1alpha1 kind: CAPIProvider metadata: name: azure namespace: capz-system spec: type: infrastructure name: azure configSecret: name: azure-variables variables: CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY: \"true\" EXP_CLUSTER_RESOURCE_SET: \"true\" EXP_MACHINE_POOL: \"true\" EXP_AKS_RESOURCE_HEALTH: \"true\" The resource defined in this yaml file will install CAPZ with support for a number of features, including CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY.","title":"Introduction","component":"turtles","version":"v0.16","name":"intro","url":"/turtles/stable/en/getting-started/cluster-class/intro.html","titles":[{"text":"Pre-requisities","hash":"_pre_requisities","id":1}]},"36":{"id":36,"text":"This section will guide you through creating a ClusterClass which you will then use to provision a workload Cluster.

We recommend you familiarize with the feature to get the most out of it. This guide uses the examples repository.

This is the base definition of the Cluster object/s that will be created from it. If the template is created optimizing flexibility, we could use it to provision workload clusters supporting variants of the same cluster shape, simplifying the configuration applied to each cluster, as the class removes most of the complexity. The template we’re using in this example will use CAPZ to provision a managed Azure (AKS) cluster. Before applying the yaml file, you will need to export the following environment variables. Remember to adapt the values to your specific scenario as these are just placeholders: export CLUSTER_CLASS_NAME=\"azure-sample\" export CLUSTER_NAME=\"azure-aks-cluster\" export AZURE_LOCATION=\"northeurope\" export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<subs-id> # you can use: az account show --query 'id' --output tsv export KUBERNETES_VERSION=\"v1.30.4\" export AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<app-id> export AZURE_TENANT_ID=<tenant-id> export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=<password> Using envsubst to substitute the exported variables in the original file. curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-turtles-fleet-example/templates/capz/cluster-template-aks-clusterclass.yaml | envsubst >> clusterclass1.yaml This will create a new yaml file clusterclass1.yaml that contains the class definition formatted with the exported values. You can study the resulting file before applying it to the cluster. kubectl apply -f clusterclass1.yaml You can validate that the class has been created successfully and inspect its content via kubectl: kubectl get clusterclasses.cluster.x-k8s.io kubectl describe clusterclasses.cluster.x-k8s.io <class-name> Now that the class resource is available in the cluster, we can go ahead and create a cluster from this topology. Let’s first substitute the variables in the template, as we did before: curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-turtles-fleet-example/templates/capz/cluster-template-aks-topology.yaml | envsubst >> cluster1.yaml This will create a new yaml file cluster1.yaml that contains the cluster definition formatted with the exported values. You can study the resulting file before applying it to the cluster, which will effectively trigger workload cluster creation. kubectl apply -f cluster1.yaml Be patient, cluster provisioning will take some time (up to 10min). While you wait for it to become ready, you can go through the capz-controller-manager logs, which is responsible for reconciling the cluster resources you just created. As with any other CAPI clusters, you will have to enable auto-import for Turtles to manage importing it into Rancher Manager. Please, refer to Mark namespace for auto-import notes to enable auto-import. The functionality provided by cluster classes makes it possible for you to deploy as many clusters as desired from the topology you created.

You can craft the YAML for your cluster manually. If you decide to do this then you can use the templates that infrastructure providers publish as part of their releases. For example, the AWS provider publishes files prefixed with cluster-template that can be used as a base. You will need to replace any tokens yourself or by using clusterctl (e.g. curl -s https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-aws/releases/download/v2.2.1/cluster-template-eks.yaml | envsubst > cluster.yaml). To maintain proper resource management and avoid accidental deletion of custom resources managed outside of Helm during Helm operations, include the helm.sh/resource-policy\": keep annotation in the top-level CAPI kinds within your cluster manifests. This guide does not use ClusterClass. Templates that use ClusterClass will require that the experimental feature be enabled. To generate the YAML for the cluster do the following (assuming the Docker infrastructure provider is being used): Open a terminal and run the following: export CLUSTER_NAME=cluster1 export CONTROL_PLANE_MACHINE_COUNT=1 export WORKER_MACHINE_COUNT=1 export KUBERNETES_VERSION=v1.30.0 export NAMESPACE=default # use the SHELL-FORMAT in envsubst to ensure we replace only the # environment variables we exported above curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-turtles-fleet-example/templates/docker-rke2.yaml | envsubst '$CLUSTER_NAME,$CONTROL_PLANE_MACHINE_COUNT,$WORKER_MACHINE_COUNT,$KUBERNETES_VERSION,$NAMESPACE' > cluster1.yaml View cluster1.yaml to ensure there are no tokens. You can make any changes you want as well. The Cluster API quickstart guide contains more detail. Read the steps related to this section here. Create a new git repository (this guide uses GitHub) Create a new folder called clusters Move the cluster1.yaml file you generated in the last section to the clusters folder. Create a file called fleet.yaml in the root and add the following contents namespace: default Commit the changes The fleet.yaml is used to specify configuration options for fleet (see docs for further details). In this instance its declaring that the cluster definitions should be added to the default namespace After the described steps there will be a repository created structure similar to the example: [https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-turtles-fleet-example] To automatically import a CAPI cluster into Rancher Manager there are 2 options: label a namespace so all clusters contained in it are imported. label an individual cluster definition so that it’s imported.

The provider will register a newly provisioned CAPI cluster with Fleet by creating a Fleet Cluster instance with the same name and namespace. Applications can be automatically deployed to the created cluster using GitOps. The provider will automatically create a Fleet ClusterGroup for every CAPI ClusterClass in the ClusterClass namespace. This enables you to deploy the same applications to all clusters created from the same ClusterClass. This allows a user to specify either a Bundle resource with raw application workloads, or GitRepo to install applications from git. Each of the resources can provide targets with any combination of: targets: - clusterGroup: <cluster-class-name> # If the cluster is created from cluster-class - clusterName: <a specific CAPI cluster name> Additionally, CAAPF automatically propagates CAPI cluster labels to the Fleet cluster resource, so user can specify a target matching common cluster label with: targets: - clusterSelector: <label selector for the cluster instances, inherited from CAPI clusters> - clusterGroupSelector: <label selector for the cluster group instances, labels inherited from ClusterClass> The following example requires Fleet version >=v0.10.1-rc.1, which is not a part of rancher/charts yet.

The end-to-end test environment used in Turtles provides a number of configuration alternatives depending on the type of test you are running and the type of checks you are performing. If getting started with the test suite, we recommend you keep your configuration as simple as possible and limit the number of customizations so you can understand the process and its configuration details. You can start your journey on provider testing by cloning the sample repository: git clone https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/turtles-integration-suite-example.git The simplest test execution you can run creates a local environment that does not use an internet-facing endpoint. This limits the checks to only local downstream clusters (effectively, CAPI clusters provisioned via CAPD) but it is enough to run the example integration. You can simply run this local version by specifying that you intend to run it locally. MANAGEMENT_CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT=\"isolated-kind\" make test When checking the integration with other infrastructure providers (e.g. providers for cloud vendors), you will have to make your Rancher instance available via endpoint to the downstream clusters, which are no longer in your local environment. The MANAGEMENT_CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT variable we used before, supports the following values: MANAGEMENT_CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT: \"kind\" # supported options are eks, isolated-kind, kind isolated-kind, which is the value we used for local testing, and kind will deploy equivalent local environments. The difference is that kind will also configure a publicly accessible endpoint via ngrok. You can get a free (limited) ngrok endpoint and use it for executing tests. Before running make test, you will also need to set the following environment variables: NGROK_API_KEY: \"\" NGROK_AUTHTOKEN: \"\" Using this configuration, during environment creation, the Rancher instance will be configured to be accessible via your ngrok endpoint and downstream clusters will be able to communicate with it. The Other options section contains more information on what you can configure before execution. In previous sections we introduced the main actions performed in the sample test integration: This is not a Turtles specific requirement as, when working with CAPI, there needs to be a management cluster that will be used to create resources that represent downstream clusters. This is the main part of the test environment and, depending on the environment variables passed to the test suite, it can either be hosted locally (using kind) or in the cloud (eks). Turtles is a Rancher extension and, as such, it needs a Rancher installation to be deployed. Rancher Manager will be run in the management cluster we created in the first step and the Turtles chart will be installed when Rancher is available. If using an internet-facing configuration, an ingress controller will make Rancher reachable from an outside network (e.g. cluster deployed in the cloud). The main test suite, and the one used as an example, is based on a GitOps flow and uses Fleet as a GitOps orchestrator tool. Based on the cluster templates provided (you can check the ones that come with the example integration here), it will create the CAPI clusters defined in the YAML files. Once this/these cluster/s are available, they will be configured to be imported into Rancher using Turtles and it will verify that the downstream cluster/s is/are accessible via Rancher. It will also check that deletion can be performed on downstream clusters and that they are no longer available in Rancher.

The main resource is the one representing the CAPI cluster as a Rancher cluster, so it can be viewed and managed via Rancher: clusters.provisioning.cattle.io We also call this resource a v1 cluster. If you were using Turtles before v0.9.0, the default import controller was based on generating this resource for every CAPI cluster that is imported into Rancher. The controller we will be migrating to was disabled behind a feature gate managementv3_cluster. Starting with Turtles v0.9.0, the v3 import controller is no longer behind a feature gate and represents the default import logic. This means we are moving to a different strategy for importing clusters, and switching to creating a different type of Rancher cluster resource: clusters.management.cattle.io Which you may also see referred to as v3 cluster. Migrating from one controller to the other should be transparent but you will need to prepare your already imported clusters for migration to prevent the new controller from duplicating resources. To make the migration procedure even easier, you can use the provided migration script which will let you specify the namespace where your imported clusters exist and will migrate them automatically. If you prefer, you can apply changes to resources manually per cluster via kubectl. Both cluster resources previously described are required to represent any Rancher clusters. This controller update only means that we’ll be creating one from Turtles and Rancher will take care of provisioning the other. This method provides an automated process to migrate clusters in batches per namespace. To prepare your imported CAPI clusters for migration via migration script, you need to follow the steps below: Select the namespace where your imported clusters are deployed. Pass the namespace as argument to the migration script: this will prepare ALL CAPI clusters in the namespace for migration. If you want to migrate each cluster independently, we recommend following the manual procedure. ./import_controller_migration.sh <cluster-ns> You can pass as many namespaces as arguments as you need. Before proceeding, you will be prompted for confirmation on the namespaces you provided. For each namespace, it automatically fetches v1 CAPI clusters that are not already migrated (an annotation is set on the resource after it is successfully prepared for migration). v1 clusters include a reference to v3 clusters via the status.clusterName field. Labels cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner and cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner-ns are added to v3 cluster. After successfully adding labels on v3 cluster resource, v1 cluster is annotated as migrated via cluster-api.cattle.io/migrated=true. Note that manually editing Kubernetes resources may cause unexpected failures due to wrong or missing values. If you are not confident with kubectl and interacting with the Kubernetes API and its resources, we recommend opting for the scripted migration. The requirement for migrating imported clusters is setting the labels used by the new controller on the clusters.management.cattle.io (v3) cluster resource. It is important to mark v1 clusters as migrated after adding the labels, as this is the method that prevents the new controller from duplicating Rancher cluster resources. Select the cluster/s you would like to prepare for migration. We’ll use cluster1 as an example for this guide. We can list the CAPI cluster resource clusters.cluster.x-k8s.io. We need to provide the corresponding namespace as this is a namespaced resource. kubectl get clusters.cluster.x-k8s.io -n capi-ns In our example we can see cluster1: NAMESPACE NAME PHASE AGE VERSION capi-ns cluster1 Provisioned 6d1h This CAPI cluster, when imported to Rancher, becomes linked to a Rancher cluster resource, represented by both clusters.provisioning.cattle.io and clusters.management.cattle.io. For now we’re interested in clusters.provisioning.cattle.io or v1 cluster. kubectl get clusters.provisioning.cattle.io -n capi-ns And we get the Rancher cluster that Turtles generated to represent the CAPI cluster. You can see that the -capi suffix is added to the resource name, which effectively allows us to filter CAPI clusters from all Rancher clusters (which may be provisioned using other mechanisms). NAME READY KUBECONFIG cluster1-capi v3 cluster resources are assigned a randomly generated name and we need to find the resource that is linked to the v1 cluster we retrieved in the previous step. We will do this by exploring the values of the resource, specifically status.clusterName. kubectl get clusters.provisioning.cattle.io -n capi-ns cluster1-capi -o jsonpath='{.status.clusterName}' The resource we get is c-m-xyz1a2b3, which is the one we’ll be labelling. Now that we know what resource to label, we can focus on what labels are required. These labels are used by the new controller to watch cluster resources. cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner # name of the cluster cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner-ns # name of the namespace where the cluster lives Note that the -capi suffix must be stripped when assigning cluster name to cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner Edit resource and apply labels. kubectl label clusters.management.cattle.io c-m-xyz1a2b3 cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner=cluster1 kubectl label clusters.management.cattle.io c-m-xyz1a2b3 cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner-ns=capi-ns You can now validate that the changes have been successfully applied. kubectl get clusters.management.cattle.io c-m-xyz1a2b3 -o jsonpath='{.metadata.labels}' After the clusters.management.cattle.io v3 resource has been updated, it is very important to mark the clusters.provisioning.cattle.io v1 resource as migrated, so the controller behaves as expected. We do this by adding the annotation cluster-api.cattle.io/migrated kubectl annotate clusters.provisioning.cattle.io -n capi-ns cluster1-capi cluster-api.cattle.io/migrated=true","title":"Upgrade Turtles import controller","component":"turtles","version":"v0.16","name":"import_controller_upgrade","url":"/turtles/stable/en/tasks/maintenance/import_controller_upgrade.html","titles":[{"text":"Context","hash":"_context","id":1},{"text":"Using the migration script - per namespace","hash":"_using_the_migration_script_per_namespace","id":2},{"text":"Manually editing resources - per cluster","hash":"_manually_editing_resources_per_cluster","id":3}]},"59":{"id":59,"text":"As most CAPI providers are upstream projects maintained by the open community, there is no safe way to guarantee that any clusters provisioned with a given provider can be imported into Rancher via Turtles. However, we do implement a certification process for those providers that: Are actively tested as part of our E2E suites. These tests are kept up-to-date to validate recent versions of the provider. Satisfy the prerequisites in the certification process. Additionally, if you are a provider developer or simply want to use a different provider that is not listed as certified, you can reuse the existing Turtles E2E suite to get started with the certification status request or simply verify that Turtles is a viable solution for you to use Rancher and CAPI together. You can read about the certification process and requirements in the Provider Certification Guide. The number of CAPI providers keeps growing and the community is coming up with new projects for different infrastructure hosts. This openness helps enrich the CAPI ecosystem but makes it impossible to control and test all providers Turtles will work with across the whole CAPI project. Developers of Turtles will maintain a list of certified providers that are actively tested and validated by CI mechanisms but this list will be limited to key and well-known providers. That is why we encourage users of providers not listed to reuse Turtles' test suite and validate the integration between the provider and Turtles. Turtles is a project that aims to be agnostic and integrate with the whole CAPI ecosystem and you are free to use it without validating any providers. Chances are you will probably find no issues with most upstream projects. As CAPI providers are projects maintained by the Kubernetes community, we cannot guarantee support for a given provider.

To simplify this task, we prepared a generic test that validates the provisioning and importing of a downstream CAPI cluster. We recommend you refer to this example on how to use Turtles' test suite. The first step in validating that your provider is compatible with Turtles and that you can provision CAPI clusters and import them into Rancher via Turtles is to integrate with our test suite. We provide a repository with an integration example that you can use as a reference for your integration. Turtles as a project contains a number of suites to verify different features and processes but, for provider certification, we require you to run only one test that uses a GitOps flow. Turtles is a project that integrates well with a GitOps approach for cluster provisioning and that is why this is our primary way of validating provider integration with Rancher. Running the full suite for a given CAPI provider will: Create a management cluster in the desired environment. Install Rancher and Turtles with all prerequisites. Install Gitea. Run the suite that will create a git repo, apply cluster template using Fleet and verify the cluster is created and successfully imported in Rancher. To successfully run the test suite, you will have to provide a number of environment variables. Some of these are agnostic, which means they are required for any provider you want to test, but others will be specific for the provider you are validating. Please, be aware of the particular specifications of the provider being tested, such as credentials, endpoints, etc. Next, we recommend you read the Test suite guide Integrating with Turtles' test suite and running checks on your provider of interest is enough to validate that it is compatible with Rancher Turtles. As it is not feasible for us to continuously test every CAPI provider, this certification workflow will allow you as a user to verify the expected functionality. However, as we are not actively testing newer iterations of the provider (with newer versions of Turtles), the support and guarantee for the given provider is limited, and you will be responsible for validating future releases. If, after successfully running checks on your provider, you would like to request it be added to the table of Certified Providers, hence being added to the project’s periodic E2E suite, you can request so via GitHub issue, using the Request for Certification template. The proposal will be studied by the community and we will decide on the feasibility of adding the provider to the certification matrix.","title":"Provider Certification Guide","component":"turtles","version":"v0.16","name":"process","url":"/turtles/stable/en/tasks/provider-certification/process.html","titles":[{"text":"Test & Certify your provider","hash":"_test_certify_your_provider","id":1},{"text":"Test configuration","hash":"_test_configuration","id":2},{"text":"Request for certification","hash":"_request_for_certification","id":3}]},"61":{"id":61,"text":"Starting with Turtles v0.9.0, the process used for importing CAPI clusters into Rancher is now based on a different controller logic.

Improvements to all areas of the project; from code, to documentation; from bug reports to feature design and UI enhancement are gratefully welcome. This guide should cover all aspects of how to interact with the project and how to get involved in development as smoothly as possible. Reading docs is often tedious, so let’s put the important contributing rule right at the top: Always be kind! Looking forward to seeing your contributions in the repo! We’d love to accept your patches in pretty much all areas of projects development! If you’re a new to the project and want to help, but don’t know where to start, here is a non-exhaustive list of ways you can help out: Submit a Pull Request Beyond fixing bugs and submitting new features, there are other things you can submit which, while less flashy, will be deeply appreciated by all who interact with the codebase: Extending test coverage! Refactoring! Reviewing and updating documentation! Adding a new UI functionality! (See also Choosing something to work on below.) Open an issue We have 2 forms of issues: bug reports and feature requests. If you are not sure which category you need, just make the best guess and provide as much information as possible. Interested in helping to improve: Rancher CAPI extension backend? Chime in on bugs or help wanted issues. If you are seeking to take on a bigger challenge or a more experienced contributor, check out feature requests. extension UI? Take a look at open or help wanted issues. maybe, user-docs? Then, jump straight into open issues in the docs repository. These guides aim to help you write issues in a way which will ensure that they are processed as quickly as possible. See below for how issues are prioritized. General rules: Before opening anything, take a good look through existing issues. More is more: give as much information as it is humanly possible to give. Highly detailed issues are more likely to be picked up because they can be prioritized and scheduled for work faster. They are also more accessible to the community, meaning that you may not have to wait for the core team to get to it. Please do not open an issue with a description that is just a link to another issue, a link to a slack conversation, a quote from either one of those, or anything else equally opaque. This raises the bar for entry and makes it hard for the community to get involved. Take the time to write a proper description and summarise key points. Take care with formatting. Ensure the markdown is tidy, use code blocks etc etc. The faster something can be read, the faster it can be dealt with. Keep it civil. Yes, it is annoying when things don’t work, but it is way more fun helping out someone who is not…​ the worst. Remember that conversing via text exacerbates everyone’s negativity bias, so throw in some emoji when in doubt. If you are here to ask for help or request some new behaviour, this is the section for you. We have curated a set of issues for anyone who simply wants to build up their open-source cred. Issues labelled good first issues should be accessible to folks new to the repos, as well as to open source in general. These issues should present a low/non-existent barrier to entry with a thorough description, easy-to-follow reproduction (if relevant) and enough context for anyone to pick up. The objective should be clear, possibly with a suggested solution or some pseudocode. If anything similar has been done, that work should be linked. If you have come across an issue tagged with good first issue which you think you would like to claim but isn’t 100% clear, please ask for more info! When people write issues there is a lot of assumed knowledge which is very often taken for granted. This is something we could all get better at, so don’t be shy in asking for what you need to do great work. See more on asking for help below! help wanted issues are for those a little more familiar with the code base, but should still be accessible enough to newcomers. All other issues labelled kind/<x> or area/<x> are also up for grabs, but are likely to require a fair amount of context. Check out the dedicated notes on getting started with development. If you need help at any stage of your work, please don’t hesitate to ask! To get more detail on the issue you have chosen, it is a good idea to start by asking whoever created it to provide more information. If you are struggling with something while working on your PR, or aren’t quite sure of your approach, you can open a draft (prefix the title with WIP:) and explain what you are thinking. Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes. Push your changes to the branch on your fork and submit a pull request to the original repository against the main branch. git push <remote-name> <feature-name> Submit a pull request. All code PR must be labeled with one of ⚠️ (:warning:, major or breaking changes) ✨ (:sparkles:, feature additions) 🐛 (:bug:, patch and bugfixes) 📖 (:book:, documentation or proposals) 🌱 (:seedling:, minor or other) Where possible, please squash your commits to ensure a tidy and descriptive history. If your PR is still a work in progress, please open a Draft PR and prefix your title with the word WIP. When your PR is ready for review, you can change the title and remove the Draft setting. We recommend that you regularly rebase from main of the original repo to keep your branch up to date. In general, we will merge a PR once a maintainer has reviewed and approved it. Trivial changes (e.g., corrections to spelling) may get waved through. For substantial changes, more people may become involved, and you might get asked to resubmit the PR or divide the changes into more than one PR. For more on how to write great commit messages, and why you should, check out this excellent blog post. We follow a rough convention for commit messages that is designed to answer three questions: what changed, why was the change made, and how did you make it. The subject line should feature the what and the body of the commit should describe the why and how. If you encountered any weirdness along the way, this is a good place to note what you discovered and how you solved it. The format can be described more formally as follows: <short title for what changed> <BLANK LINE> <why this change was made and what changed> <BLANK LINE> <any interesting details> <footer> The first line is the subject and should be no longer than 70 characters, the second line is always blank, and other lines should be wrapped at a max of 80 characters. This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools. There is a template recommend for use here. The core team regularly processes incoming issues. There may be some delay over holiday periods. Every issue will be assigned a priority/<x> label. The levels of priorities are: critical-urgent: These are time sensitive issues which should be picked up immediately. If an issue labelled critical is not assigned or being actively worked on, someone is expected to drop what they’re doing immediately to work on it. This usually means the core team, but community members are welcome to claim issues at any priority level if they get there first. However, given the pressing timeframe, should a non-core contributor request to be assigned to a critical issue, they will be paired with a core team-member to manage the tracking, communication and release of any fix as well as to assume responsibility of all progess. important-soon: Must be assigned as soon as capacity becomes available. Ideally something should be delivered in time for the next release. important-longterm: Important over the long term, but may not be currently staffed and/or may require multiple releases to complete. backlog: There appears to be general agreement that this would be good to have, but we may not have anyone available to work on it right now or in the immediate future. PRs are still very welcome, although it might take a while to get them reviewed if reviewers are fully occupied with higher priority issues, for example immediately before a release. These priority categories have been inspired by the Kubernetes contributing guide. Other labels include: adr-required: Indicates that the issue or PR contains a decision that needs to be documented in a ADR before it can be worked on. needs-investigation: There is currently insufficient information to either categorize properly, or to understand and implement a solution. This could be because the issue opener did not provide enough relevant information, or because more in-depth research is required before work can begin. The core team aims to clear the PR queue as quickly as possible. Community members should also feel free to keep an eye on things and provide their own thoughts and expertise. High-value and/or high priority contributions will be processed as quickly as possible, while lower priority or nice-to-have things may take a little longer to get approved. To help facilitate a smoother and faster review, follow the guidelines above. Submissions which do not meet standards will be de-prioritised for review. Please feel free to skip this and sub-section below, since they are only relevant to the rancher-turtles repository. Any impactful decisions to the architecture, design, development and behaviour of rancher-turtles must be recorded in the form of an ADR. A template can be found at docs/adr/0000-template.md of the repo, with numerous examples of completed records in the same directory. Contributors are also welcome to backfill ADRs if they are found to be missing. Start a new discussion using the ADR category. Choose an appropriate clear and concise title (e.g. ADR: Implement X in Go). Provide a context of the decision to be made. Describe the various options, if more than one, and explain the pros and cons. Highlight any areas which you would like the reviewers to pay attention to, or those on which you would specifically like an opinion.

For example: helm install ... --set infrastructure=\"docker:v1.7.7;aws:v2.6.1\" The infrastructure flag is set to docker:v1.7.7;aws:v2.6.1, representing the desired provider names. This means that the Cluster API Operator will install and manage multiple providers, Docker and AWS, with versions v1.7.7 and v2.6.1 respectively. The cluster is now ready to install Rancher Turtles. The default behavior when installing the chart is to install Cluster API Operator as a Helm dependency. Since we decided to install it manually before installing Rancher Turtles, the feature cluster-api-operator.enabled must be explicitly disabled as otherwise it would conflict with the existing installation. You can refer to Install Rancher Turtles without Cluster API Operator to see next steps.

To provision and configure Cluster API providers, Turtles uses the CAPIProvider resource to allow managing Cluster API Operator manifests in a declarative way. Every field provided by the upstream CAPI Operator resource for the desired spec.type is also available in the spec of the CAPIProvider resouce. To install Cluster API providers in an air-gapped environment the following will need to be done: Configure the Cluster API Operator for an air-gapped environment: The operator chart will be fetched and stored as a part of the Turtles chart. Provide image overrides for the operator from an accessible image repository. Configure Cluster API providers for an air-gapped environment: Provide fetch configuration for each provider from an accessible location (e.g., an internal github/gitlab server) or from pre-created ConfigMaps within the cluster. Provide image overrides for each provider to pull images from an accessible image repository. Configure Rancher Turtles for an air-gapped environment: Collect and publish Rancher Turtles images and publish to the private registry. Example of cert-manager installation for the reference. Provide fetch configuration and image values for core and caprke2 providers in values.yaml. Provider image value for the Cluster API Operator helm chart dependency in values.yaml. Image values specified with the cluster-api-operator key will be passed along to the Cluster API Operator. As an admin, I need to fetch the vSphere provider (CAPV) components from within the cluster because I am working in an air-gapped environment. In this example, there is a ConfigMap in the capv-system namespace that defines the components and metadata of the provider. It can be created manually or by running the following commands: # Get the file contents from the GitHub release curl -L https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/cluster-api-provider-vsphere/releases/download/v1.11.2/infrastructure-components.yaml -o components.yaml curl -L https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/cluster-api-provider-vsphere/releases/download/v1.11.2/metadata.yaml -o metadata.yaml # Create the configmap from the files kubectl create configmap v1.11.2 --namespace=capv-system --from-file=components=components.yaml --from-file=metadata=metadata.yaml --dry-run=client -o yaml > configmap.yaml This command example would need to be adapted to the provider and version you want to use. The resulting config map will look similar to the example below: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: labels: provider-components: vsphere name: v1.11.2 namespace: capv-system data: components: | # Components for v1.11.2 YAML go here metadata: | # Metadata information goes here A CAPIProvider resource will need to be created to represent the vSphere infrastructure provider. It will need to be configured with a fetchConfig. The label selector allows the operator to determine the available versions of the vSphere provider and the Kubernetes resources that need to be deployed (i.e. contained within ConfigMaps which match the label selector). Since the provider’s version is marked as v1.11.2, the operator uses the components information from the ConfigMap with matching label to install the vSphere provider. apiVersion: turtles-capi.cattle.io/v1alpha1 kind: CAPIProvider metadata: name: vsphere namespace: capv-system spec: name: vsphere type: infrastructure version: v1.11.2 configSecret: name: vsphere-variables fetchConfig: selector: matchLabels: provider-components: vsphere deployment: containers: - name: manager imageUrl: \"registry.suse.com/rancher/cluster-api-vsphere-controller:v1.11.2\" variables: CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY: \"true\" EXP_CLUSTER_RESOURCE_SET: \"true\" EXP_MACHINE_POOL: \"true\" Additionally the CAPIProvider overrides the container image to use for the provider using the deployment.containers[].imageUrl field. This allows the operator to pull the image from a registry within the air-gapped environment. There is a limit on the maximum size of a ConfigMap - 1MiB. If the manifests do not fit into this size, Kubernetes will generate an error and provider installation fail. To avoid this, you can archive the manifests and put them in the ConfigMap that way. For example, you have two files: components.yaml and metadata.yaml. To create a working config map you need: Archive components.yaml using gzip cli tool gzip -c components.yaml > components.gz Create a ConfigMap manifest from the archived data kubectl create configmap v1.11.2 --namespace=capv-system --from-file=components=components.gz --from-file=metadata=metadata.yaml --dry-run=client -o yaml > configmap.yaml Edit the file by adding \"provider.cluster.x-k8s.io/compressed: true\" annotation yq eval -i '.metadata.annotations += {\"provider.cluster.x-k8s.io/compressed\": \"true\"}' configmap.yaml without this annotation operator won’t be able to determine if the data is compressed or not. Add labels that will be used to match the ConfigMap in fetchConfig section of the provider yq eval -i '.metadata.labels += {\"my-label\": \"label-value\"}' configmap.yaml Create a ConfigMap in your kubernetes cluster using kubectl kubectl create -f configmap.yaml","title":"Air-gapped environment","component":"turtles","version":"v0.15","name":"air-gapped-environment","url":"/turtles/v0.15/en/getting-started/air-gapped-environment.html","titles":[{"text":"Example Usage","hash":"_example_usage","id":1},{"text":"Situation when manifests do not fit into ConfigMap","hash":"_situation_when_manifests_do_not_fit_into_configmap","id":2}]},"68":{"id":68,"text":"If you’re already running Rancher, you can skip this section and jump to Install Rancher Turtles.

See core provider Or Cluster API Operator project The Cluster API Operator is a sub-project of the SIG-cluster-lifecycle. It is designed to empower cluster administrators to handle the lifecycle of Cluster API providers within a management cluster using a declarative approach. Cluster API Provider RKE2 is a combination of two provider types: a Cluster API Control Plane Provider for provisioning Kubernetes control plane nodes and a Cluster API Bootstrap Provider for bootstrapping Kubernetes on a machine where RKE2 is used as the Kubernetes distro. The set of Kubernetes services that form the basis of a cluster. See also https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/#_kubernetes-control-plane There are two variants: Self-provisioned: A Kubernetes control plane consisting of pods or machines wholly managed by a single Cluster API deployment. External or Managed: A control plane offered and controlled by some system other than Cluster API (e.g., GKE, AKS, EKS, IKS). Refers to a provider that implements a solution for the management of a Kubernetes control plane. See CAPRRKE2, KCP. Refers to a provider that implements Cluster API core controllers; if you consider that the first project that must be deployed in a management Cluster is Cluster API itself, it should be clear why the Cluster API project is also referred to as the core provider. See CAPI. A container management and deployment engine designed to offer users more control on the local cluster and constant monitoring through GitOps. Take a look at fleet documentation to know more about Fleet. Refers to a provider that implements provisioning of infrastructure/computational resources required by the Cluster or by Machines (e.g. VMs, networking, etc.). Clouds infrastructure providers include AWS, Azure, or Google; while VMware, MAAS, or metal3.io can be defined as bare metal providers.

For example: EKS, OKE, AKS, GKE, IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, DOKS, and many more throughout the Kubernetes Cloud Native ecosystem. See Topology The cluster where one or more Infrastructure Providers run, and where resources (e.g. Machines) are stored. Typically referred to when you are provisioning multiple workload clusters. A node pool is a group of nodes within a cluster that all have the same configuration. Or OS A generically understood combination of a kernel and system-level userspace interface, such as Linux or Windows, as opposed to a particular distribution. Pivot is a process for moving the provider components and declared cluster-api resources from a Source Management cluster to a Target Management cluster. The pivot process is also used for deleting a management cluster and could also be used during an upgrade of the management cluster. Or Cluster API provider This term was originally used as abbreviation for Infrastructure provider, but currently it is used to refer to any project that can be deployed and provides functionality to the Cluster API management Cluster. See Bootstrap provider, Control plane provider, Core provider, Infrastructure provider, IPAM provider, Runtime extension provider. Refers to the YAML artifact published as part of the release process for providers; it usually includes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), Deployments (to run the controller manager), RBAC, etc. In some cases, the same expression is used to refer to the instances of above components deployed in a management cluster.

An open-source platform designed to simplify the deployment and management of Kubernetes clusters. A component deployed by Rancher in each Kubernetes cluster it manages. Its primary role is to establish a secure communication channel between the Rancher server and the Kubernetes cluster, enabling Rancher to manage and interact with the cluster. The Rancher Manager (or Rancher Server) is where the Rancher UI and API are hosted, and it communicates with managed clusters through components like the Rancher Cluster Agent. It allows users to manage their Kubernetes clusters, applications, and Rancher-specific resources such as Catalogs, Users, Global Roles, and more.

Rancher Turtles meets SLSA Level 3 requirements. Requirement Required at SLSA L3 Met by Rancher Turtles Choose an appropriate build platform Yes Yes Follow a consistent build process Yes Yes Distribute provenance Yes Yes The Rancher Turtles project uses Git for source code management. All the Rancher Turtles maintainers are required to have two-factor authentication enabled, to sign and sign off on all their contributions. The Rancher Turtles project uses GitHub Actions and GitHub Runners for building all its release artifacts. The build and release process runs in isolation on an ephemeral environment provided by GitHub-hosted runners. The build and release process is defined in code and is kept under version control. The GitHub Workflows make use of GitHub Actions pinned to certain versions and are kept up-to-date using GitHub Dependabot. All changes to the build and release process are done via Pull Requests that must be approved by at least one Rancher Turtles maintainer. The release process can only be kicked off by a Rancher Turtles maintainer by pushing a Git tag in the semver format. The Rancher Turtles project uses the official SLSA GitHub Generator project for provenance generation and distribution. The provenance for the release artifacts published to GitHub Container Registry and to Rancher Prime Registry is generated using the generator_container_slsa3 GitHub Workflow provided by the SLSA GitHub Generator project. The provenance identifies the Rancher Turtles container images using their digest in SHA-256 format. The provenance is signed by Sigstore Cosign using the GitHub OIDC identity, and the public key to verify the provenance is stored in the public Rekor transparency log. The release process and the provenance generation are run in isolation on an ephemeral environment provided by GitHub-hosted runners. The provenance of the Rancher Turtles container images can be verified using the official SLSA verifier tool. The provenance generation workflows run on ephemeral and isolated virtual machines, which are fully managed by GitHub. The provenance signing secrets are ephemeral and are generated through Sigstore’s keyless signing procedure. The SLSA GitHub Generator runs on separate virtual machines than the build and release process, so that the Rancher Turtles build scripts don’t have access to the signing secrets. The release process and the provenance generation are run in isolation on an ephemeral environment provided by GitHub-hosted runners. The provenance generation is decoupled from the build process; the SLSA GitHub Generator runs on separate virtual machines fully managed by GitHub. The release process can’t access the provenance signing key because the provenance generator runs in isolation on separate GitHub-hosted runners.","title":"SLSA","component":"turtles","version":"v0.15","name":"slsa","url":"/turtles/v0.15/en/security/slsa.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Build Platform","hash":"_build_platform","id":2},{"text":"Build Process","hash":"_build_process","id":3},{"text":"Provenance","hash":"_provenance","id":4},{"text":"Isolation","hash":"_isolation","id":5}]},"73":{"id":73,"text":"In this section we cover additional operation tasks.","title":"Introduction","component":"turtles","version":"v0.15","name":"intro","url":"/turtles/v0.15/en/tasks/intro.html","titles":[]},"74":{"id":74,"text":"This section will guide you through creating a cluster that utilizes ClusterClass using a GitOps workflow with Fleet.

Remember to adapt the values to your specific scenario as these are just placeholders: export CLUSTER_CLASS_NAME=\"azure-sample\" export CLUSTER_NAME=\"azure-aks-cluster\" export AZURE_LOCATION=\"northeurope\" export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<subs-id> # you can use: az account show --query 'id' --output tsv export KUBERNETES_VERSION=\"v1.30.4\" export AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<app-id> export AZURE_TENANT_ID=<tenant-id> export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=<password> Using envsubst to substitute the exported variables in the original file. curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-turtles-fleet-example/templates/capz/cluster-template-aks-clusterclass.yaml | envsubst >> clusterclass1.yaml This will create a new yaml file clusterclass1.yaml that contains the class definition formatted with the exported values. You can study the resulting file before applying it to the cluster. kubectl apply -f clusterclass1.yaml You can validate that the class has been created successfully and inspect its content via kubectl: kubectl get clusterclasses.cluster.x-k8s.io kubectl describe clusterclasses.cluster.x-k8s.io <class-name> Now that the class resource is available in the cluster, we can go ahead and create a cluster from this topology. Let’s first substitute the variables in the template, as we did before: curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-turtles-fleet-example/templates/capz/cluster-template-aks-topology.yaml | envsubst >> cluster1.yaml This will create a new yaml file cluster1.yaml that contains the cluster definition formatted with the exported values. You can study the resulting file before applying it to the cluster, which will effectively trigger workload cluster creation. kubectl apply -f cluster1.yaml Be patient, cluster provisioning will take some time (up to 10min). While you wait for it to become ready, you can go through the capz-controller-manager logs, which is responsible for reconciling the cluster resources you just created. As with any other CAPI clusters, you will have to enable auto-import for Turtles to manage importing it into Rancher Manager. Please, refer to Mark namespace for auto-import notes to enable auto-import. The functionality provided by cluster classes makes it possible for you to deploy as many clusters as desired from the topology you created. This template can be written in a way that makes it flexible enough to be used in as many Clusters as possible by supporting variants of the same base Cluster shape.","title":"Create a workload cluster","component":"turtles","version":"v0.15","name":"provision","url":"/turtles/v0.15/en/getting-started/cluster-class/provision.html","titles":[{"text":"Providers Guide","hash":"_providers_guide","id":1},{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"_prerequisites","id":2},{"text":"Create ClusterClass object","hash":"_create_clusterclass_object","id":3},{"text":"Provision workload cluster","hash":"_provision_workload_cluster","id":4},{"text":"Enable auto-import into Rancher","hash":"_enable_auto_import_into_rancher","id":5},{"text":"Post provisioning actions","hash":"_post_provisioning_actions","id":6}]},"77":{"id":77,"text":"Everything you need to know about creating and importing your first CAPI cluster with Rancher Turtles.

You can craft the YAML for your cluster manually. If you decide to do this then you can use the templates that infrastructure providers publish as part of their releases. For example, the AWS provider publishes files prefixed with cluster-template that can be used as a base. You will need to replace any tokens yourself or by using clusterctl (e.g. curl -s https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-aws/releases/download/v2.2.1/cluster-template-eks.yaml | envsubst > cluster.yaml). To maintain proper resource management and avoid accidental deletion of custom resources managed outside of Helm during Helm operations, include the helm.sh/resource-policy\": keep annotation in the top-level CAPI kinds within your cluster manifests. This guide does not use ClusterClass. Templates that use ClusterClass will require that the experimental feature be enabled. To generate the YAML for the cluster do the following (assuming the Docker infrastructure provider is being used): Open a terminal and run the following: export CLUSTER_NAME=cluster1 export CONTROL_PLANE_MACHINE_COUNT=1 export WORKER_MACHINE_COUNT=1 export KUBERNETES_VERSION=v1.30.0 curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-turtles-fleet-example/templates/docker-rke2.yaml | envsubst > cluster1.yaml View cluster1.yaml to ensure there are no tokens. You can make any changes you want as well. The Cluster API quickstart guide contains more detail. Read the steps related to this section here. Create a new git repository (this guide uses GitHub) Create a new folder called clusters Move the cluster1.yaml file you generated in the last section to the clusters folder. Create a file called fleet.yaml in the root and add the following contents namespace: default Commit the changes The fleet.yaml is used to specify configuration options for fleet (see docs for further details). In this instance its declaring that the cluster definitions should be added to the default namespace After the described steps there will be a repository created structure similar to the example: [https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-turtles-fleet-example] To automatically import a CAPI cluster into Rancher Manager there are 2 options: label a namespace so all clusters contained in it are imported. label an individual cluster definition so that it’s imported. In both cases the label is cluster-api.cattle.io/rancher-auto-import. This walkthrough will use the first option of importing all clusters in a namespace. Open a terminal Label the default namespace in your Rancher Manager cluster: kubectl label namespace default cluster-api.cattle.io/rancher-auto-import=true Now the cluster definitions are committed to a git repository they can be used to provision the clusters. To do this they will need to be imported into the Rancher Manager cluster (which is also acting as a Cluster API management cluster) using the Continuous Delivery feature (which uses Fleet). There are 2 options to provide the configuration. The first is using the Rancher Manager UI and the second is by applying some YAML to your cluster. Both are covered below.

The end-to-end test environment used in Turtles provides a number of configuration alternatives depending on the type of test you are running and the type of checks you are performing. If getting started with the test suite, we recommend you keep your configuration as simple as possible and limit the number of customizations so you can understand the process and its configuration details. You can start your journey on provider testing by cloning the sample repository: git clone https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/turtles-integration-suite-example.git The simplest test execution you can run creates a local environment that does not use an internet-facing endpoint. This limits the checks to only local downstream clusters (effectively, CAPI clusters provisioned via CAPD) but it is enough to run the example integration. You can simply run this local version by specifying that you intend to run it locally. MANAGEMENT_CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT=\"isolated-kind\" make test When checking the integration with other infrastructure providers (e.g. providers for cloud vendors), you will have to make your Rancher instance available via endpoint to the downstream clusters, which are no longer in your local environment. The MANAGEMENT_CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT variable we used before, supports the following values: MANAGEMENT_CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT: \"kind\" # supported options are eks, isolated-kind, kind isolated-kind, which is the value we used for local testing, and kind will deploy equivalent local environments. The difference is that kind will also configure a publicly accessible endpoint via ngrok. You can get a free (limited) ngrok endpoint and use it for executing tests. Before running make test, you will also need to set the following environment variables: NGROK_API_KEY: \"\" NGROK_AUTHTOKEN: \"\" Using this configuration, during environment creation, the Rancher instance will be configured to be accessible via your ngrok endpoint and downstream clusters will be able to communicate with it. The Other options section contains more information on what you can configure before execution. In previous sections we introduced the main actions performed in the sample test integration: This is not a Turtles specific requirement as, when working with CAPI, there needs to be a management cluster that will be used to create resources that represent downstream clusters. This is the main part of the test environment and, depending on the environment variables passed to the test suite, it can either be hosted locally (using kind) or in the cloud (eks). Turtles is a Rancher extension and, as such, it needs a Rancher installation to be deployed. Rancher Manager will be run in the management cluster we created in the first step and the Turtles chart will be installed when Rancher is available. If using an internet-facing configuration, an ingress controller will make Rancher reachable from an outside network (e.g. cluster deployed in the cloud). The main test suite, and the one used as an example, is based on a GitOps flow and uses Fleet as a GitOps orchestrator tool. Based on the cluster templates provided (you can check the ones that come with the example integration here), it will create the CAPI clusters defined in the YAML files. Once this/these cluster/s are available, they will be configured to be imported into Rancher using Turtles and it will verify that the downstream cluster/s is/are accessible via Rancher. It will also check that deletion can be performed on downstream clusters and that they are no longer available in Rancher.

The main resource is the one representing the CAPI cluster as a Rancher cluster, so it can be viewed and managed via Rancher: clusters.provisioning.cattle.io We also call this resource a v1 cluster. If you were using Turtles before v0.9.0, the default import controller was based on generating this resource for every CAPI cluster that is imported into Rancher. The controller we will be migrating to was disabled behind a feature gate managementv3_cluster. Starting with Turtles v0.9.0, the v3 import controller is no longer behind a feature gate and represents the default import logic. This means we are moving to a different strategy for importing clusters, and switching to creating a different type of Rancher cluster resource: clusters.management.cattle.io Which you may also see referred to as v3 cluster. Migrating from one controller to the other should be transparent but you will need to prepare your already imported clusters for migration to prevent the new controller from duplicating resources. To make the migration procedure even easier, you can use the provided migration script which will let you specify the namespace where your imported clusters exist and will migrate them automatically. If you prefer, you can apply changes to resources manually per cluster via kubectl. Both cluster resources previously described are required to represent any Rancher clusters. This controller update only means that we’ll be creating one from Turtles and Rancher will take care of provisioning the other. This method provides an automated process to migrate clusters in batches per namespace. To prepare your imported CAPI clusters for migration via migration script, you need to follow the steps below: Select the namespace where your imported clusters are deployed. Pass the namespace as argument to the migration script: this will prepare ALL CAPI clusters in the namespace for migration. If you want to migrate each cluster independently, we recommend following the manual procedure. ./import_controller_migration.sh <cluster-ns> You can pass as many namespaces as arguments as you need. Before proceeding, you will be prompted for confirmation on the namespaces you provided. For each namespace, it automatically fetches v1 CAPI clusters that are not already migrated (an annotation is set on the resource after it is successfully prepared for migration). v1 clusters include a reference to v3 clusters via the status.clusterName field. Labels cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner and cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner-ns are added to v3 cluster. After successfully adding labels on v3 cluster resource, v1 cluster is annotated as migrated via cluster-api.cattle.io/migrated=true. Note that manually editing Kubernetes resources may cause unexpected failures due to wrong or missing values. If you are not confident with kubectl and interacting with the Kubernetes API and its resources, we recommend opting for the scripted migration. The requirement for migrating imported clusters is setting the labels used by the new controller on the clusters.management.cattle.io (v3) cluster resource. It is important to mark v1 clusters as migrated after adding the labels, as this is the method that prevents the new controller from duplicating Rancher cluster resources. Select the cluster/s you would like to prepare for migration. We’ll use cluster1 as an example for this guide. We can list the CAPI cluster resource clusters.cluster.x-k8s.io. We need to provide the corresponding namespace as this is a namespaced resource. kubectl get clusters.cluster.x-k8s.io -n capi-ns In our example we can see cluster1: NAMESPACE NAME PHASE AGE VERSION capi-ns cluster1 Provisioned 6d1h This CAPI cluster, when imported to Rancher, becomes linked to a Rancher cluster resource, represented by both clusters.provisioning.cattle.io and clusters.management.cattle.io. For now we’re interested in clusters.provisioning.cattle.io or v1 cluster. kubectl get clusters.provisioning.cattle.io -n capi-ns And we get the Rancher cluster that Turtles generated to represent the CAPI cluster. You can see that the -capi suffix is added to the resource name, which effectively allows us to filter CAPI clusters from all Rancher clusters (which may be provisioned using other mechanisms). NAME READY KUBECONFIG cluster1-capi v3 cluster resources are assigned a randomly generated name and we need to find the resource that is linked to the v1 cluster we retrieved in the previous step. We will do this by exploring the values of the resource, specifically status.clusterName. kubectl get clusters.provisioning.cattle.io -n capi-ns cluster1-capi -o jsonpath='{.status.clusterName}' The resource we get is c-m-xyz1a2b3, which is the one we’ll be labelling. Now that we know what resource to label, we can focus on what labels are required. These labels are used by the new controller to watch cluster resources. cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner # name of the cluster cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner-ns # name of the namespace where the cluster lives Note that the -capi suffix must be stripped when assigning cluster name to cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner Edit resource and apply labels. kubectl label clusters.management.cattle.io c-m-xyz1a2b3 cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner=cluster1 kubectl label clusters.management.cattle.io c-m-xyz1a2b3 cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner-ns=capi-ns You can now validate that the changes have been successfully applied. kubectl get clusters.management.cattle.io c-m-xyz1a2b3 -o jsonpath='{.metadata.labels}' After the clusters.management.cattle.io v3 resource has been updated, it is very important to mark the clusters.provisioning.cattle.io v1 resource as migrated, so the controller behaves as expected.

That is why we encourage users of providers not listed to reuse Turtles' test suite and validate the integration between the provider and Turtles. Turtles is a project that aims to be agnostic and integrate with the whole CAPI ecosystem and you are free to use it without validating any providers.

To simplify this task, we prepared a generic test that validates the provisioning and importing of a downstream CAPI cluster. We recommend you refer to this example on how to use Turtles' test suite. The first step in validating that your provider is compatible with Turtles and that you can provision CAPI clusters and import them into Rancher via Turtles is to integrate with our test suite. We provide a repository with an integration example that you can use as a reference for your integration. Turtles as a project contains a number of suites to verify different features and processes but, for provider certification, we require you to run only one test that uses a GitOps flow. Turtles is a project that integrates well with a GitOps approach for cluster provisioning and that is why this is our primary way of validating provider integration with Rancher. Running the full suite for a given CAPI provider will: Create a management cluster in the desired environment. Install Rancher and Turtles with all prerequisites. Install Gitea. Run the suite that will create a git repo, apply cluster template using Fleet and verify the cluster is created and successfully imported in Rancher. To successfully run the test suite, you will have to provide a number of environment variables. Some of these are agnostic, which means they are required for any provider you want to test, but others will be specific for the provider you are validating. Please, be aware of the particular specifications of the provider being tested, such as credentials, endpoints, etc. Next, we recommend you read the Test suite guide Integrating with Turtles' test suite and running checks on your provider of interest is enough to validate that it is compatible with Rancher Turtles. As it is not feasible for us to continuously test every CAPI provider, this certification workflow will allow you as a user to verify the expected functionality. However, as we are not actively testing newer iterations of the provider (with newer versions of Turtles), the support and guarantee for the given provider is limited, and you will be responsible for validating future releases.

Submitting PRs Choosing something to work on Developing rancher-turtles Asking for help PR submission guidelines Commit message formatting Opening Issues How the Maintainers process contributions Prioritizing issues Reviewing PRs ADRs (Architectural Decision Records) Process Thank you for taking the time to contribute to Rancher CAPI extension projects. Improvements to all areas of the project; from code, to documentation; from bug reports to feature design and UI enhancement are gratefully welcome. This guide should cover all aspects of how to interact with the project and how to get involved in development as smoothly as possible. Reading docs is often tedious, so let’s put the important contributing rule right at the top: Always be kind! Looking forward to seeing your contributions in the repo! We’d love to accept your patches in pretty much all areas of projects development! If you’re a new to the project and want to help, but don’t know where to start, here is a non-exhaustive list of ways you can help out: Submit a Pull Request Beyond fixing bugs and submitting new features, there are other things you can submit which, while less flashy, will be deeply appreciated by all who interact with the codebase: Extending test coverage! Refactoring! Reviewing and updating documentation! Adding a new UI functionality! (See also Choosing something to work on below.) Open an issue We have 2 forms of issues: bug reports and feature requests. If you are not sure which category you need, just make the best guess and provide as much information as possible. Interested in helping to improve: Rancher CAPI extension backend? Chime in on bugs or help wanted issues. If you are seeking to take on a bigger challenge or a more experienced contributor, check out feature requests. extension UI? Take a look at open or help wanted issues. maybe, user-docs? Then, jump straight into open issues in the docs repository. These guides aim to help you write issues in a way which will ensure that they are processed as quickly as possible. See below for how issues are prioritized. General rules: Before opening anything, take a good look through existing issues. More is more: give as much information as it is humanly possible to give. Highly detailed issues are more likely to be picked up because they can be prioritized and scheduled for work faster. They are also more accessible to the community, meaning that you may not have to wait for the core team to get to it. Please do not open an issue with a description that is just a link to another issue, a link to a slack conversation, a quote from either one of those, or anything else equally opaque. This raises the bar for entry and makes it hard for the community to get involved. Take the time to write a proper description and summarise key points. Take care with formatting. Ensure the markdown is tidy, use code blocks etc etc. The faster something can be read, the faster it can be dealt with. Keep it civil. Yes, it is annoying when things don’t work, but it is way more fun helping out someone who is not…​ the worst. Remember that conversing via text exacerbates everyone’s negativity bias, so throw in some emoji when in doubt. If you are here to ask for help or request some new behaviour, this is the section for you. We have curated a set of issues for anyone who simply wants to build up their open-source cred. Issues labelled good first issues should be accessible to folks new to the repos, as well as to open source in general. These issues should present a low/non-existent barrier to entry with a thorough description, easy-to-follow reproduction (if relevant) and enough context for anyone to pick up. The objective should be clear, possibly with a suggested solution or some pseudocode. If anything similar has been done, that work should be linked. If you have come across an issue tagged with good first issue which you think you would like to claim but isn’t 100% clear, please ask for more info! When people write issues there is a lot of assumed knowledge which is very often taken for granted. This is something we could all get better at, so don’t be shy in asking for what you need to do great work. See more on asking for help below! help wanted issues are for those a little more familiar with the code base, but should still be accessible enough to newcomers. All other issues labelled kind/<x> or area/<x> are also up for grabs, but are likely to require a fair amount of context. Check out the dedicated notes on getting started with development. If you need help at any stage of your work, please don’t hesitate to ask! To get more detail on the issue you have chosen, it is a good idea to start by asking whoever created it to provide more information. If you are struggling with something while working on your PR, or aren’t quite sure of your approach, you can open a draft (prefix the title with WIP:) and explain what you are thinking. Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes. Push your changes to the branch on your fork and submit a pull request to the original repository against the main branch. git push <remote-name> <feature-name> Submit a pull request. All code PR must be labeled with one of ⚠️ (:warning:, major or breaking changes) ✨ (:sparkles:, feature additions) 🐛 (:bug:, patch and bugfixes) 📖 (:book:, documentation or proposals) 🌱 (:seedling:, minor or other) Where possible, please squash your commits to ensure a tidy and descriptive history. If your PR is still a work in progress, please open a Draft PR and prefix your title with the word WIP. When your PR is ready for review, you can change the title and remove the Draft setting. We recommend that you regularly rebase from main of the original repo to keep your branch up to date. In general, we will merge a PR once a maintainer has reviewed and approved it. Trivial changes (e.g., corrections to spelling) may get waved through. For substantial changes, more people may become involved, and you might get asked to resubmit the PR or divide the changes into more than one PR. For more on how to write great commit messages, and why you should, check out this excellent blog post. We follow a rough convention for commit messages that is designed to answer three questions: what changed, why was the change made, and how did you make it. The subject line should feature the what and the body of the commit should describe the why and how. If you encountered any weirdness along the way, this is a good place to note what you discovered and how you solved it. The format can be described more formally as follows: <short title for what changed> <BLANK LINE> <why this change was made and what changed> <BLANK LINE> <any interesting details> <footer> The first line is the subject and should be no longer than 70 characters, the second line is always blank, and other lines should be wrapped at a max of 80 characters. This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools. There is a template recommend for use here. The core team regularly processes incoming issues. There may be some delay over holiday periods. Every issue will be assigned a priority/<x> label. The levels of priorities are: critical-urgent: These are time sensitive issues which should be picked up immediately. If an issue labelled critical is not assigned or being actively worked on, someone is expected to drop what they’re doing immediately to work on it. This usually means the core team, but community members are welcome to claim issues at any priority level if they get there first. However, given the pressing timeframe, should a non-core contributor request to be assigned to a critical issue, they will be paired with a core team-member to manage the tracking, communication and release of any fix as well as to assume responsibility of all progess. important-soon: Must be assigned as soon as capacity becomes available. Ideally something should be delivered in time for the next release. important-longterm: Important over the long term, but may not be currently staffed and/or may require multiple releases to complete. backlog: There appears to be general agreement that this would be good to have, but we may not have anyone available to work on it right now or in the immediate future. PRs are still very welcome, although it might take a while to get them reviewed if reviewers are fully occupied with higher priority issues, for example immediately before a release. These priority categories have been inspired by the Kubernetes contributing guide. Other labels include: adr-required: Indicates that the issue or PR contains a decision that needs to be documented in a ADR before it can be worked on. needs-investigation: There is currently insufficient information to either categorize properly, or to understand and implement a solution. This could be because the issue opener did not provide enough relevant information, or because more in-depth research is required before work can begin. The core team aims to clear the PR queue as quickly as possible. Community members should also feel free to keep an eye on things and provide their own thoughts and expertise. High-value and/or high priority contributions will be processed as quickly as possible, while lower priority or nice-to-have things may take a little longer to get approved. To help facilitate a smoother and faster review, follow the guidelines above. Submissions which do not meet standards will be de-prioritised for review. Please feel free to skip this and sub-section below, since they are only relevant to the rancher-turtles repository. Any impactful decisions to the architecture, design, development and behaviour of rancher-turtles must be recorded in the form of an ADR. A template can be found at docs/adr/0000-template.md of the repo, with numerous examples of completed records in the same directory. Contributors are also welcome to backfill ADRs if they are found to be missing. Start a new discussion using the ADR category. Choose an appropriate clear and concise title (e.g. ADR: Implement X in Go). Provide a context of the decision to be made. Describe the various options, if more than one, and explain the pros and cons. Highlight any areas which you would like the reviewers to pay attention to, or those on which you would specifically like an opinion. Tag in the maintainers as the \"Deciders\", and invite them to participate and weigh in on the decision and its consequences. Once a decision has been made, open a PR adding a new ADR to the directory.

This section describes how to install Cluster API Operator in the Kubernetes cluster. CAPI and desired CAPI providers could be installed using the helm-based installation for Cluster API Operator or as a helm dependency for the Rancher Turtles. To install Cluster API Operator with version 1.7.3 of the CAPI + Docker provider using helm, follow these steps: Add the Helm repository for the Cluster API Operator: helm repo add capi-operator https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/cluster-api-operator helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io Update the Helm repository: helm repo update Install the Cert-Manager: helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --namespace cert-manager --create-namespace --set installCRDs=true Install the Cluster API Operator: helm install capi-operator capi-operator/cluster-api-operator --create-namespace -n capi-operator-system --set infrastructure=docker:v1.7.7 --set core=cluster-api:v1.7.7 --timeout 90s --wait # Core Cluster API with kubeadm bootstrap and control plane providers will also be installed cert-manager is a hard requirement for CAPI and Cluster API Operator* To provide additional environment variables, enable feature gates, or supply cloud credentials, similar to clusterctl common provider, variables secret with name and a namespace of the secret could be specified for the Cluster API Operator as shown below. helm install capi-operator capi-operator/cluster-api-operator --create-namespace -n capi-operator-system --set infrastructure=docker:v1.7.7 --set core=cluster-api:v1.7.7 --timeout 90s --secret-name <secret_name> --wait Example secret data: apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: variables namespace: default type: Opaque stringData: CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY: \"true\" EXP_CLUSTER_RESOURCE_SET: \"true\" To select more than one desired provider to be installed together with the Cluster API Operator, the --infrastructure flag can be specified with multiple provider names separated by a comma. For example: helm install ... --set infrastructure=\"docker:v1.7.7;aws:v2.6.1\" The infrastructure flag is set to docker:v1.7.7;aws:v2.6.1, representing the desired provider names. This means that the Cluster API Operator will install and manage multiple providers, Docker and AWS, with versions v1.7.7 and v2.6.1 respectively. The cluster is now ready to install Rancher Turtles. The default behavior when installing the chart is to install Cluster API Operator as a Helm dependency. Since we decided to install it manually before installing Rancher Turtles, the feature cluster-api-operator.enabled must be explicitly disabled as otherwise it would conflict with the existing installation. You can refer to Install Rancher Turtles without Cluster API Operator to see next steps. For more fine-grained control of the providers and other components installed with CAPI, see the Add the infrastructure provider section. This option is only suitable for development purposes and not recommended for production environments. The rancher-turtles chart is available in https://rancher.github.io/turtles and this Helm repository must be added before proceeding with the installation: helm repo add turtles https://rancher.github.io/turtles helm repo update and then it can be installed into the rancher-turtles-system namespace with: helm install rancher-turtles turtles/rancher-turtles --version v0.13.0 -n rancher-turtles-system --set cluster-api-operator.enabled=false --set cluster-api-operator.cluster-api.enabled=false --create-namespace --wait --dependency-update As you can see, we are telling Helm to ignore installing cluster-api-operator as a dependency.","title":"Installing Cluster API Operator","component":"turtles","version":"v0.14","name":"install_capi_operator","url":"/turtles/v0.14/en/developer-guide/install_capi_operator.html","titles":[{"text":"Installing Cluster API (CAPI) and providers","hash":"_installing_cluster_api_capi_and_providers","id":1},{"text":"Install manually with Helm (alternative)","hash":"_install_manually_with_helm_alternative","id":2},{"text":"Install Rancher Turtles without Cluster API Operator as a Helm dependency","hash":"_install_rancher_turtles_without_cluster_api_operator_as_a_helm_dependency","id":3}]},"105":{"id":105,"text":"Everything you need to know about developing Rancher Turtles.","title":"Introduction","component":"turtles","version":"v0.14","name":"intro","url":"/turtles/v0.14/en/developer-guide/intro.html","titles":[]},"106":{"id":106,"text":"Rancher Turtles provides support for an air-gapped environment out-of-the-box by leveraging features of the Cluster API Operator, the required dependency for installing Rancher Turtles. To provision and configure Cluster API providers, Turtles uses the CAPIProvider resource to allow managing Cluster API Operator manifests in a declarative way. Every field provided by the upstream CAPI Operator resource for the desired spec.type is also available in the spec of the CAPIProvider resouce. To install Cluster API providers in an air-gapped environment the following will need to be done: Configure the Cluster API Operator for an air-gapped environment: The operator chart will be fetched and stored as a part of the Turtles chart. Provide image overrides for the operator from an accessible image repository. Configure Cluster API providers for an air-gapped environment: Provide fetch configuration for each provider from an accessible location (e.g., an internal github/gitlab server) or from pre-created ConfigMaps within the cluster. Provide image overrides for each provider to pull images from an accessible image repository. Configure Rancher Turtles for an air-gapped environment: Collect and publish Rancher Turtles images and publish to the private registry. Example of cert-manager installation for the reference. Provide fetch configuration and image values for core and caprke2 providers in values.yaml. Provider image value for the Cluster API Operator helm chart dependency in values.yaml. Image values specified with the cluster-api-operator key will be passed along to the Cluster API Operator. As an admin, I need to fetch the vSphere provider (CAPV) components from within the cluster because I am working in an air-gapped environment. In this example, there is a ConfigMap in the capv-system namespace that defines the components and metadata of the provider. It can be created manually or by running the following commands: # Get the file contents from the GitHub release curl -L https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/cluster-api-provider-vsphere/releases/download/v1.11.2/infrastructure-components.yaml -o components.yaml curl -L https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/cluster-api-provider-vsphere/releases/download/v1.11.2/metadata.yaml -o metadata.yaml # Create the configmap from the files kubectl create configmap v1.11.2 --namespace=capv-system --from-file=components=components.yaml --from-file=metadata=metadata.yaml --dry-run=client -o yaml > configmap.yaml This command example would need to be adapted to the provider and version you want to use. The resulting config map will look similar to the example below: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: labels: provider-components: vsphere name: v1.11.2 namespace: capv-system data: components: | # Components for v1.11.2 YAML go here metadata: | # Metadata information goes here A CAPIProvider resource will need to be created to represent the vSphere infrastructure provider. It will need to be configured with a fetchConfig. The label selector allows the operator to determine the available versions of the vSphere provider and the Kubernetes resources that need to be deployed (i.e. contained within ConfigMaps which match the label selector). Since the provider’s version is marked as v1.11.2, the operator uses the components information from the ConfigMap with matching label to install the vSphere provider. apiVersion: turtles-capi.cattle.io/v1alpha1 kind: CAPIProvider metadata: name: vsphere namespace: capv-system spec: name: vsphere type: infrastructure version: v1.11.2 configSecret: name: vsphere-variables fetchConfig: selector: matchLabels: provider-components: vsphere deployment: containers: - name: manager imageUrl: \"registry.suse.com/rancher/cluster-api-vsphere-controller:v1.11.2\" variables: CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY: \"true\" EXP_CLUSTER_RESOURCE_SET: \"true\" EXP_MACHINE_POOL: \"true\" Additionally the CAPIProvider overrides the container image to use for the provider using the deployment.containers[].imageUrl field. This allows the operator to pull the image from a registry within the air-gapped environment. There is a limit on the maximum size of a ConfigMap - 1MiB. If the manifests do not fit into this size, Kubernetes will generate an error and provider installation fail. To avoid this, you can archive the manifests and put them in the ConfigMap that way. For example, you have two files: components.yaml and metadata.yaml. To create a working config map you need: Archive components.yaml using gzip cli tool gzip -c components.yaml > components.gz Create a ConfigMap manifest from the archived data kubectl create configmap v1.11.2 --namespace=capv-system --from-file=components=components.gz --from-file=metadata=metadata.yaml --dry-run=client -o yaml > configmap.yaml Edit the file by adding \"provider.cluster.x-k8s.io/compressed: true\" annotation yq eval -i '.metadata.annotations += {\"provider.cluster.x-k8s.io/compressed\": \"true\"}' configmap.yaml without this annotation operator won’t be able to determine if the data is compressed or not. Add labels that will be used to match the ConfigMap in fetchConfig section of the provider yq eval -i '.metadata.labels += {\"my-label\": \"label-value\"}' configmap.yaml Create a ConfigMap in your kubernetes cluster using kubectl kubectl create -f configmap.yaml","title":"Air-gapped environment","component":"turtles","version":"v0.14","name":"air-gapped-environment","url":"/turtles/v0.14/en/getting-started/air-gapped-environment.html","titles":[{"text":"Example Usage","hash":"_example_usage","id":1},{"text":"Situation when manifests do not fit into ConfigMap","hash":"_situation_when_manifests_do_not_fit_into_configmap","id":2}]},"107":{"id":107,"text":"If you’re already running Rancher, you can skip this section and jump to Install Rancher Turtles.

The pivot process is also used for deleting a management cluster and could also be used during an upgrade of the management cluster. Or Cluster API provider This term was originally used as abbreviation for Infrastructure provider, but currently it is used to refer to any project that can be deployed and provides functionality to the Cluster API management Cluster. See Bootstrap provider, Control plane provider, Core provider, Infrastructure provider, IPAM provider, Runtime extension provider. Refers to the YAML artifact published as part of the release process for providers; it usually includes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), Deployments (to run the controller manager), RBAC, etc. In some cases, the same expression is used to refer to the instances of above components deployed in a management cluster. See Provider repository Refers to the location where the YAML for provider components are hosted; usually a provider repository hosts many version of provider components, one for each released version. An open-source platform designed to simplify the deployment and management of Kubernetes clusters. A component deployed by Rancher in each Kubernetes cluster it manages. Its primary role is to establish a secure communication channel between the Rancher server and the Kubernetes cluster, enabling Rancher to manage and interact with the cluster. The Rancher Manager (or Rancher Server) is where the Rancher UI and API are hosted, and it communicates with managed clusters through components like the Rancher Cluster Agent. It allows users to manage their Kubernetes clusters, applications, and Rancher-specific resources such as Catalogs, Users, Global Roles, and more. Rancher’s next-generation, fully conformant Kubernetes distribution that focuses on security and compliance within the U.S. Federal Government sector. See documentation for more details. An external component which is part of a system built on top of Cluster API that can handle requests for a specific Runtime Hook. Refers to a provider that implements one or more runtime extensions. Unless otherwise specified, this refers to horizontal scaling. A control plane node where etcd is colocated with the Kubernetes API server, and is running as a static pod. The infrastructure that backs a Machine Resource, typically either a cloud instance, virtual machine, or physical host. A Kubernetes operator that provides integration between Rancher Manager and Cluster API (CAPI) with the aim of bringing full CAPI support to Rancher. A field in the Cluster object spec that allows defining and managing the shape of the Cluster’s control plane and worker machines from a single point of control. The Cluster’s topology is based on a ClusterClass. Sometimes it is also referred as a managed topology. See ClusterClass Refers to Rancher Turtles A cluster created by a ClusterAPI controller, which is not a bootstrap cluster, and is meant to be used by end-users, as opposed to by CAPI tooling. A collection of templates that define a set of worker nodes in the cluster. A ClusterClass contains zero or more WorkerClass definitions.

The specification set by SLSA is useful for both software producers and consumers: producers can follow SLSA’s guidelines to make their software supply chain more secure, and consumers can use SLSA to make decisions about whether to trust a software package. Rancher Turtles meets SLSA Level 3 requirements. Requirement Required at SLSA L3 Met by Rancher Turtles Choose an appropriate build platform Yes Yes Follow a consistent build process Yes Yes Distribute provenance Yes Yes The Rancher Turtles project uses Git for source code management. All the Rancher Turtles maintainers are required to have two-factor authentication enabled, to sign and sign off on all their contributions. The Rancher Turtles project uses GitHub Actions and GitHub Runners for building all its release artifacts. The build and release process runs in isolation on an ephemeral environment provided by GitHub-hosted runners. The build and release process is defined in code and is kept under version control. The GitHub Workflows make use of GitHub Actions pinned to certain versions and are kept up-to-date using GitHub Dependabot. All changes to the build and release process are done via Pull Requests that must be approved by at least one Rancher Turtles maintainer. The release process can only be kicked off by a Rancher Turtles maintainer by pushing a Git tag in the semver format. The Rancher Turtles project uses the official SLSA GitHub Generator project for provenance generation and distribution. The provenance for the release artifacts published to GitHub Container Registry and to Rancher Prime Registry is generated using the generator_container_slsa3 GitHub Workflow provided by the SLSA GitHub Generator project. The provenance identifies the Rancher Turtles container images using their digest in SHA-256 format. The provenance is signed by Sigstore Cosign using the GitHub OIDC identity, and the public key to verify the provenance is stored in the public Rekor transparency log. The release process and the provenance generation are run in isolation on an ephemeral environment provided by GitHub-hosted runners. The provenance of the Rancher Turtles container images can be verified using the official SLSA verifier tool. The provenance generation workflows run on ephemeral and isolated virtual machines, which are fully managed by GitHub. The provenance signing secrets are ephemeral and are generated through Sigstore’s keyless signing procedure. The SLSA GitHub Generator runs on separate virtual machines than the build and release process, so that the Rancher Turtles build scripts don’t have access to the signing secrets. The release process and the provenance generation are run in isolation on an ephemeral environment provided by GitHub-hosted runners. The provenance generation is decoupled from the build process; the SLSA GitHub Generator runs on separate virtual machines fully managed by GitHub. The release process can’t access the provenance signing key because the provenance generator runs in isolation on separate GitHub-hosted runners.","title":"SLSA","component":"turtles","version":"v0.14","name":"slsa","url":"/turtles/v0.14/en/security/slsa.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Build Platform","hash":"_build_platform","id":2},{"text":"Build Process","hash":"_build_process","id":3},{"text":"Provenance","hash":"_provenance","id":4},{"text":"Isolation","hash":"_isolation","id":5}]},"112":{"id":112,"text":"In this section we cover additional operation tasks.","title":"Introduction","component":"turtles","version":"v0.14","name":"intro","url":"/turtles/v0.14/en/tasks/intro.html","titles":[]},"113":{"id":113,"text":"This section will guide you through creating a cluster that utilizes ClusterClass using a GitOps workflow with Fleet.

ClusterClass is an experimental feature of Cluster API. As with any experimental features it should be used with caution as it may be unreliable. All experimental features are not subject to any compatibility or deprecation promise. It is planned to be graduated with CAPI v1.9. Before using ClusterClass, study the provider docs and confirm that the feature is supported. This documentation includes a matrix in the Certified providers section with cluster topology support status. To use ClusterClass it needs to be enabled for core Cluster API and any provider that supports it. This is done by setting the CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY variable to true. The Rancher Turtles Helm chart will automatically enable the feature when installing CAPI. However, when enabling additional providers, ensure CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY is set in the provider configuration. Turtles' CAPIProvider resource supports passing installation parameters to the provider via variables as follows: apiVersion: turtles-capi.cattle.io/v1alpha1 kind: CAPIProvider metadata: name: azure namespace: capz-system spec: type: infrastructure name: azure configSecret: name: azure-variables variables: CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY: \"true\" EXP_CLUSTER_RESOURCE_SET: \"true\" EXP_MACHINE_POOL: \"true\" EXP_AKS_RESOURCE_HEALTH: \"true\" The resource defined in this yaml file will install CAPZ with support for a number of features, including CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY.","title":"Introduction","component":"turtles","version":"v0.14","name":"intro","url":"/turtles/v0.14/en/getting-started/cluster-class/intro.html","titles":[{"text":"Pre-requisities","hash":"_pre_requisities","id":1}]},"115":{"id":115,"text":"This section will guide you through creating a ClusterClass which you will then use to provision a workload Cluster.

This is the base definition of the Cluster object/s that will be created from it. If the template is created optimizing flexibility, we could use it to provision workload clusters supporting variants of the same cluster shape, simplifying the configuration applied to each cluster, as the class removes most of the complexity. The template we’re using in this example will use CAPZ to provision a managed Azure (AKS) cluster. Before applying the yaml file, you will need to export the following environment variables. Remember to adapt the values to your specific scenario as these are just placeholders: export CLUSTER_CLASS_NAME=\"azure-sample\" export CLUSTER_NAME=\"azure-aks-cluster\" export AZURE_LOCATION=\"northeurope\" export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<subs-id> # you can use: az account show --query 'id' --output tsv export KUBERNETES_VERSION=\"v1.30.4\" export AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<app-id> export AZURE_TENANT_ID=<tenant-id> export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=<password> Using envsubst to substitute the exported variables in the original file. curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-turtles-fleet-example/templates/capz/cluster-template-aks-clusterclass.yaml | envsubst >> clusterclass1.yaml This will create a new yaml file clusterclass1.yaml that contains the class definition formatted with the exported values. You can study the resulting file before applying it to the cluster. kubectl apply -f clusterclass1.yaml You can validate that the class has been created successfully and inspect its content via kubectl: kubectl get clusterclasses.cluster.x-k8s.io kubectl describe clusterclasses.cluster.x-k8s.io <class-name> Now that the class resource is available in the cluster, we can go ahead and create a cluster from this topology. Let’s first substitute the variables in the template, as we did before: curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-turtles-fleet-example/templates/capz/cluster-template-aks-topology.yaml | envsubst >> cluster1.yaml This will create a new yaml file cluster1.yaml that contains the cluster definition formatted with the exported values. You can study the resulting file before applying it to the cluster, which will effectively trigger workload cluster creation. kubectl apply -f cluster1.yaml Be patient, cluster provisioning will take some time (up to 10min). While you wait for it to become ready, you can go through the capz-controller-manager logs, which is responsible for reconciling the cluster resources you just created. As with any other CAPI clusters, you will have to enable auto-import for Turtles to manage importing it into Rancher Manager. Please, refer to Mark namespace for auto-import notes to enable auto-import. The functionality provided by cluster classes makes it possible for you to deploy as many clusters as desired from the topology you created.

You can craft the YAML for your cluster manually. If you decide to do this then you can use the templates that infrastructure providers publish as part of their releases. For example, the AWS provider publishes files prefixed with cluster-template that can be used as a base.

To maintain proper resource management and avoid accidental deletion of custom resources managed outside of Helm during Helm operations, include the helm.sh/resource-policy\": keep annotation in the top-level CAPI kinds within your cluster manifests. This guide does not use ClusterClass. Templates that use ClusterClass will require that the experimental feature be enabled.

Create a file called fleet.yaml in the root and add the following contents namespace: default Commit the changes The fleet.yaml is used to specify configuration options for fleet (see docs for further details). In this instance its declaring that the cluster definitions should be added to the default namespace After the described steps there will be a repository created structure similar to the example: [https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-turtles-fleet-example] To automatically import a CAPI cluster into Rancher Manager there are 2 options: label a namespace so all clusters contained in it are imported. label an individual cluster definition so that it’s imported.

CAPI Operator allows handling the lifecycle of Cluster API Providers using a declarative approach, extending the capabilities of clusterctl. If you want to learn more about it, you can refer to Cluster API Operator book. Before installing Rancher Turtles in your Rancher environment, Rancher’s embedded-cluster-api functionality must be disabled. This includes also cleaning up Rancher-specific webhooks that otherwise would conflict with CAPI ones. To simplify setting up Rancher for installing Rancher Turtles, the official Rancher Turtles Helm chart includes a pre-install hook that applies these changes, making it transparent to the end user: Disable the embedded-cluster-api feature in Rancher. Delete the mutating-webhook-configuration and validating-webhook-configuration webhooks that are no longer needed. If you would like to understand how Rancher Turtles works and what the architecture looks like, you can refer to the Architecture section. If uninstalling, you can refer to Uninstalling Rancher Turtles The rancher-turtles chart is available in https://rancher.github.io/turtles and this Helm repository must be added before proceeding with the installation: helm repo add turtles https://rancher.github.io/turtles helm repo update As mentioned before, installing Rancher Turtles requires the Cluster API Operator and the Helm chart can handle its installation automatically with a minimum set of flags: helm install rancher-turtles turtles/rancher-turtles --version v0.13.0 \\ -n rancher-turtles-system \\ --dependency-update \\ --create-namespace --wait \\ --timeout 180s This operation could take a few minutes and, after installing, you can take some time to study the installed controllers, including: rancher-turtles-controller. capi-operator. For a list of Rancher Turtles versions, refer to Releases page. This is the basic, recommended configuration, which manages the creation of a secret containing the required CAPI feature flags (CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY, EXP_CLUSTER_RESOURCE_SET and EXP_MACHINE_POOL enabled) in the core provider namespace.

Before installing Rancher Turtles in your Rancher environment, Rancher’s embedded-cluster-api functionality must be disabled. This includes also cleaning up Rancher-specific webhooks that otherwise would conflict with CAPI ones. To simplify setting up Rancher for installing Rancher Turtles, the official Rancher Turtles Helm chart includes a pre-install hook that applies these changes, making it transparent to the end user: Disable the embedded-cluster-api feature in Rancher. Delete the mutating-webhook-configuration and validating-webhook-configuration webhooks that are no longer needed.

The end-to-end test environment used in Turtles provides a number of configuration alternatives depending on the type of test you are running and the type of checks you are performing. If getting started with the test suite, we recommend you keep your configuration as simple as possible and limit the number of customizations so you can understand the process and its configuration details. You can start your journey on provider testing by cloning the sample repository: git clone https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/turtles-integration-suite-example.git The simplest test execution you can run creates a local environment that does not use an internet-facing endpoint. This limits the checks to only local downstream clusters (effectively, CAPI clusters provisioned via CAPD) but it is enough to run the example integration. You can simply run this local version by specifying that you intend to run it locally. MANAGEMENT_CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT=\"isolated-kind\" make test When checking the integration with other infrastructure providers (e.g. providers for cloud vendors), you will have to make your Rancher instance available via endpoint to the downstream clusters, which are no longer in your local environment. The MANAGEMENT_CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT variable we used before, supports the following values: MANAGEMENT_CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT: \"kind\" # supported options are eks, isolated-kind, kind isolated-kind, which is the value we used for local testing, and kind will deploy equivalent local environments. The difference is that kind will also configure a publicly accessible endpoint via ngrok. You can get a free (limited) ngrok endpoint and use it for executing tests. Before running make test, you will also need to set the following environment variables: NGROK_API_KEY: \"\" NGROK_AUTHTOKEN: \"\" Using this configuration, during environment creation, the Rancher instance will be configured to be accessible via your ngrok endpoint and downstream clusters will be able to communicate with it. The Other options section contains more information on what you can configure before execution. In previous sections we introduced the main actions performed in the sample test integration: This is not a Turtles specific requirement as, when working with CAPI, there needs to be a management cluster that will be used to create resources that represent downstream clusters. This is the main part of the test environment and, depending on the environment variables passed to the test suite, it can either be hosted locally (using kind) or in the cloud (eks). Turtles is a Rancher extension and, as such, it needs a Rancher installation to be deployed. Rancher Manager will be run in the management cluster we created in the first step and the Turtles chart will be installed when Rancher is available. If using an internet-facing configuration, an ingress controller will make Rancher reachable from an outside network (e.g. cluster deployed in the cloud). The main test suite, and the one used as an example, is based on a GitOps flow and uses Fleet as a GitOps orchestrator tool. Based on the cluster templates provided (you can check the ones that come with the example integration here), it will create the CAPI clusters defined in the YAML files. Once this/these cluster/s are available, they will be configured to be imported into Rancher using Turtles and it will verify that the downstream cluster/s is/are accessible via Rancher. It will also check that deletion can be performed on downstream clusters and that they are no longer available in Rancher.

It takes precedence over embedded defaults or clusterctl default set of provider definitions. ADR To use the ClusterctlConfig resource: Create a ClusterctlConfig resource with the clusterctl-config name in the turtles namespace. The ClusterctlConfig controller will handle updates for the ConfigMap mounted to the cluster-api-operator with the required clusterctl configuration based on the ClusterctlConfig spec. Manage the ClusterctlConfig object declaratively to apply changes to the generated provider configurations. It may require some time for changes to take effect, as kubelet takes care of updating mounted point based on ConfigMap state. Here is an example ClusterctlConfig manifest: apiVersion: turtles-capi.cattle.io/v1alpha1 kind: ClusterctlConfig metadata: name: clusterctl-config namespace: rancher-turtles-system spec: providers: - name: metal3 url: https://github.com/metal3-io/cluster-api-provider-metal3/releases/v1.7.1/infrastructure-components.yaml type: InfrastructureProvider This example will generate a clusterctl configuration for the metal3 provider with the specified URL and type. The key fields in the ClusterctlConfig spec are: providers[].name - Name of the provider (e.g. metal3) providers[].url - URL of the provider configuration (e.g. https://github.com/metal3-io/cluster-api-provider-metal3/releases/v1.7.1/infrastructure-components.yaml). This can use latest release, if supported, or pin the maximum version to v1.7.1 for example. providers[].type - Type of the provider (e.g. InfrastructureProvider) When a ClusterctlConfig resource is deleted, the config map is reverted to its original state, managed by turtles.","title":"ClusterctlConfig Resource","component":"turtles","version":"v0.14","name":"clusterctlconfig_resource","url":"/turtles/v0.14/en/tasks/capi-operator/clusterctlconfig_resource.html","titles":[{"text":"Usage","hash":"_usage","id":1},{"text":"Specification","hash":"_specification","id":2},{"text":"Deletion","hash":"_deletion","id":3}]},"134":{"id":134,"text":"This section describes how to install the CoreProvider via CAPIProvider, which is responsible for managing the Cluster API CRDs and the Cluster API controller.

The main resource is the one representing the CAPI cluster as a Rancher cluster, so it can be viewed and managed via Rancher: clusters.provisioning.cattle.io We also call this resource a v1 cluster. If you were using Turtles before v0.9.0, the default import controller was based on generating this resource for every CAPI cluster that is imported into Rancher. The controller we will be migrating to was disabled behind a feature gate managementv3_cluster. Starting with Turtles v0.9.0, the v3 import controller is no longer behind a feature gate and represents the default import logic. This means we are moving to a different strategy for importing clusters, and switching to creating a different type of Rancher cluster resource: clusters.management.cattle.io Which you may also see referred to as v3 cluster. Migrating from one controller to the other should be transparent but you will need to prepare your already imported clusters for migration to prevent the new controller from duplicating resources. To make the migration procedure even easier, you can use the provided migration script which will let you specify the namespace where your imported clusters exist and will migrate them automatically. If you prefer, you can apply changes to resources manually per cluster via kubectl. Both cluster resources previously described are required to represent any Rancher clusters. This controller update only means that we’ll be creating one from Turtles and Rancher will take care of provisioning the other. This method provides an automated process to migrate clusters in batches per namespace. To prepare your imported CAPI clusters for migration via migration script, you need to follow the steps below: Select the namespace where your imported clusters are deployed. Pass the namespace as argument to the migration script: this will prepare ALL CAPI clusters in the namespace for migration. If you want to migrate each cluster independently, we recommend following the manual procedure. ./import_controller_migration.sh <cluster-ns> You can pass as many namespaces as arguments as you need. Before proceeding, you will be prompted for confirmation on the namespaces you provided. For each namespace, it automatically fetches v1 CAPI clusters that are not already migrated (an annotation is set on the resource after it is successfully prepared for migration). v1 clusters include a reference to v3 clusters via the status.clusterName field. Labels cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner and cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner-ns are added to v3 cluster. After successfully adding labels on v3 cluster resource, v1 cluster is annotated as migrated via cluster-api.cattle.io/migrated=true. Note that manually editing Kubernetes resources may cause unexpected failures due to wrong or missing values. If you are not confident with kubectl and interacting with the Kubernetes API and its resources, we recommend opting for the scripted migration. The requirement for migrating imported clusters is setting the labels used by the new controller on the clusters.management.cattle.io (v3) cluster resource. It is important to mark v1 clusters as migrated after adding the labels, as this is the method that prevents the new controller from duplicating Rancher cluster resources. Select the cluster/s you would like to prepare for migration. We’ll use cluster1 as an example for this guide. We can list the CAPI cluster resource clusters.cluster.x-k8s.io. We need to provide the corresponding namespace as this is a namespaced resource. kubectl get clusters.cluster.x-k8s.io -n capi-ns In our example we can see cluster1: NAMESPACE NAME PHASE AGE VERSION capi-ns cluster1 Provisioned 6d1h This CAPI cluster, when imported to Rancher, becomes linked to a Rancher cluster resource, represented by both clusters.provisioning.cattle.io and clusters.management.cattle.io. For now we’re interested in clusters.provisioning.cattle.io or v1 cluster. kubectl get clusters.provisioning.cattle.io -n capi-ns And we get the Rancher cluster that Turtles generated to represent the CAPI cluster. You can see that the -capi suffix is added to the resource name, which effectively allows us to filter CAPI clusters from all Rancher clusters (which may be provisioned using other mechanisms). NAME READY KUBECONFIG cluster1-capi v3 cluster resources are assigned a randomly generated name and we need to find the resource that is linked to the v1 cluster we retrieved in the previous step. We will do this by exploring the values of the resource, specifically status.clusterName. kubectl get clusters.provisioning.cattle.io -n capi-ns cluster1-capi -o jsonpath='{.status.clusterName}' The resource we get is c-m-xyz1a2b3, which is the one we’ll be labelling. Now that we know what resource to label, we can focus on what labels are required. These labels are used by the new controller to watch cluster resources. cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner # name of the cluster cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner-ns # name of the namespace where the cluster lives Note that the -capi suffix must be stripped when assigning cluster name to cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner Edit resource and apply labels. kubectl label clusters.management.cattle.io c-m-xyz1a2b3 cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner=cluster1 kubectl label clusters.management.cattle.io c-m-xyz1a2b3 cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner-ns=capi-ns You can now validate that the changes have been successfully applied. kubectl get clusters.management.cattle.io c-m-xyz1a2b3 -o jsonpath='{.metadata.labels}' After the clusters.management.cattle.io v3 resource has been updated, it is very important to mark the clusters.provisioning.cattle.io v1 resource as migrated, so the controller behaves as expected. We do this by adding the annotation cluster-api.cattle.io/migrated kubectl annotate clusters.provisioning.cattle.io -n capi-ns cluster1-capi cluster-api.cattle.io/migrated=true","title":"Upgrade Turtles import controller","component":"turtles","version":"v0.14","name":"import_controller_upgrade","url":"/turtles/v0.14/en/tasks/maintenance/import_controller_upgrade.html","titles":[{"text":"Context","hash":"_context","id":1},{"text":"Using the migration script - per namespace","hash":"_using_the_migration_script_per_namespace","id":2},{"text":"Manually editing resources - per cluster","hash":"_manually_editing_resources_per_cluster","id":3}]},"138":{"id":138,"text":"As most CAPI providers are upstream projects maintained by the open community, there is no safe way to guarantee that any clusters provisioned with a given provider can be imported into Rancher via Turtles.

To simplify this task, we prepared a generic test that validates the provisioning and importing of a downstream CAPI cluster. We recommend you refer to this example on how to use Turtles' test suite. The first step in validating that your provider is compatible with Turtles and that you can provision CAPI clusters and import them into Rancher via Turtles is to integrate with our test suite. We provide a repository with an integration example that you can use as a reference for your integration. Turtles as a project contains a number of suites to verify different features and processes but, for provider certification, we require you to run only one test that uses a GitOps flow. Turtles is a project that integrates well with a GitOps approach for cluster provisioning and that is why this is our primary way of validating provider integration with Rancher. Running the full suite for a given CAPI provider will: Create a management cluster in the desired environment. Install Rancher and Turtles with all prerequisites. Install Gitea. Run the suite that will create a git repo, apply cluster template using Fleet and verify the cluster is created and successfully imported in Rancher. To successfully run the test suite, you will have to provide a number of environment variables. Some of these are agnostic, which means they are required for any provider you want to test, but others will be specific for the provider you are validating. Please, be aware of the particular specifications of the provider being tested, such as credentials, endpoints, etc. Next, we recommend you read the Test suite guide Integrating with Turtles' test suite and running checks on your provider of interest is enough to validate that it is compatible with Rancher Turtles. As it is not feasible for us to continuously test every CAPI provider, this certification workflow will allow you as a user to verify the expected functionality. However, as we are not actively testing newer iterations of the provider (with newer versions of Turtles), the support and guarantee for the given provider is limited, and you will be responsible for validating future releases. If, after successfully running checks on your provider, you would like to request it be added to the table of Certified Providers, hence being added to the project’s periodic E2E suite, you can request so via GitHub issue, using the Request for Certification template.

To provision and configure Cluster API providers, Turtles uses the CAPIProvider resource to allow managing Cluster API Operator manifests in a declarative way. Every field provided by the upstream CAPI Operator resource for the desired spec.type is also available in the spec of the CAPIProvider resouce. To install Cluster API providers in an air-gapped environment the following will need to be done: Configure the Cluster API Operator for an air-gapped environment: The operator chart will be fetched and stored as a part of the Turtles chart. Provide image overrides for the operator from an accessible image repository. Configure Cluster API providers for an air-gapped environment: Provide fetch configuration for each provider from an accessible location (e.g., an internal github/gitlab server) or from pre-created ConfigMaps within the cluster. Provide image overrides for each provider to pull images from an accessible image repository. Configure Rancher Turtles for an air-gapped environment: Collect and publish Rancher Turtles images and publish to the private registry. Example of cert-manager installation for the reference. Provide fetch configuration and image values for core and caprke2 providers in values.yaml. Provider image value for the Cluster API Operator helm chart dependency in values.yaml. Image values specified with the cluster-api-operator key will be passed along to the Cluster API Operator. As an admin, I need to fetch the vSphere provider (CAPV) components from within the cluster because I am working in an air-gapped environment. In this example, there is a ConfigMap in the capv-system namespace that defines the components and metadata of the provider. It can be created manually or by running the following commands: # Get the file contents from the GitHub release curl -L https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-vsphere/releases/download/v1.8.5/infrastructure-components.yaml -o components.yaml curl -L https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-vsphere/releases/download/v1.8.5/metadata.yaml -o metadata.yaml # Create the configmap from the files kubectl create configmap v1.8.5 --namespace=capv-system --from-file=components=components.yaml --from-file=metadata=metadata.yaml --dry-run=client -o yaml > configmap.yaml This command example would need to be adapted to the provider and version you want to use. The resulting config map will look similar to the example below: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: labels: provider-components: vsphere name: v1.8.5 namespace: capv-system data: components: | # Components for v1.8.5 YAML go here metadata: | # Metadata information goes here A CAPIProvider resource will need to be created to represent the vSphere infrastructure provider. It will need to be configured with a fetchConfig. The label selector allows the operator to determine the available versions of the vSphere provider and the Kubernetes resources that need to be deployed (i.e. contained within ConfigMaps which match the label selector). Since the provider’s version is marked as v1.8.5, the operator uses the components information from the ConfigMap with matching label to install the vSphere provider. apiVersion: turtles-capi.cattle.io/v1alpha1 kind: CAPIProvider metadata: name: vsphere namespace: capv-system spec: name: vsphere type: infrastructure version: v1.8.5 configSecret: name: vsphere-variables fetchConfig: selector: matchLabels: provider-components: vsphere deployment: containers: - name: manager imageUrl: \"gcr.io/myregistry/capv-controller:v1.8.5-foo\" variables: CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY: \"true\" EXP_CLUSTER_RESOURCE_SET: \"true\" EXP_MACHINE_POOL: \"true\" Additionally the CAPIProvider overrides the container image to use for the provider using the deployment.containers[].imageUrl field. This allows the operator to pull the image from a registry within the air-gapped environment. There is a limit on the maximum size of a ConfigMap - 1MiB. If the manifests do not fit into this size, Kubernetes will generate an error and provider installation fail. To avoid this, you can archive the manifests and put them in the ConfigMap that way. For example, you have two files: components.yaml and metadata.yaml. To create a working config map you need: Archive components.yaml using gzip cli tool gzip -c components.yaml > components.gz Create a ConfigMap manifest from the archived data kubectl create configmap v1.8.5 --namespace=capv-system --from-file=components=components.gz --from-file=metadata=metadata.yaml --dry-run=client -o yaml > configmap.yaml Edit the file by adding \"provider.cluster.x-k8s.io/compressed: true\" annotation yq eval -i '.metadata.annotations += {\"provider.cluster.x-k8s.io/compressed\": \"true\"}' configmap.yaml without this annotation operator won’t be able to determine if the data is compressed or not.

When installing Rancher Turtles in your Rancher environment, by default, Rancher Turtles enables the Cluster API Operator cleanup. This includes cleaning up Cluster API Operator specific webhooks and deployments that otherwise cause issues with Rancher provisioning. To simplify uninstalling Rancher Turtles (via Rancher Manager or helm command), the official Rancher Turtles Helm chart includes a post-delete hook that applies these changes, making it transparent to the end user: Delete the mutating-webhook-configuration and validating-webhook-configuration webhooks that are no longer needed. Delete the CAPI deployments that are no longer needed. To uninstall the Rancher Turtles Extension use the following helm command: helm uninstall -n rancher-turtles-system rancher-turtles --cascade foreground --wait This may take a few minutes to complete.

Submitting PRs Choosing something to work on Developing rancher-turtles Asking for help PR submission guidelines Commit message formatting Opening Issues How the Maintainers process contributions Prioritizing issues Reviewing PRs ADRs (Architectural Decision Records) Process Thank you for taking the time to contribute to Rancher CAPI extension projects. Improvements to all areas of the project; from code, to documentation; from bug reports to feature design and UI enhancement are gratefully welcome. This guide should cover all aspects of how to interact with the project and how to get involved in development as smoothly as possible. Reading docs is often tedious, so let’s put the important contributing rule right at the top: Always be kind! Looking forward to seeing your contributions in the repo! We’d love to accept your patches in pretty much all areas of projects development! If you’re a new to the project and want to help, but don’t know where to start, here is a non-exhaustive list of ways you can help out: Submit a Pull Request Beyond fixing bugs and submitting new features, there are other things you can submit which, while less flashy, will be deeply appreciated by all who interact with the codebase: Extending test coverage! Refactoring! Reviewing and updating documentation! Adding a new UI functionality! (See also Choosing something to work on below.) Open an issue We have 2 forms of issues: bug reports and feature requests. If you are not sure which category you need, just make the best guess and provide as much information as possible. Interested in helping to improve: Rancher CAPI extension backend? Chime in on bugs or help wanted issues. If you are seeking to take on a bigger challenge or a more experienced contributor, check out feature requests. extension UI? Take a look at open or help wanted issues. maybe, user-docs? Then, jump straight into open issues in the docs repository. These guides aim to help you write issues in a way which will ensure that they are processed as quickly as possible. See below for how issues are prioritized. General rules: Before opening anything, take a good look through existing issues. More is more: give as much information as it is humanly possible to give. Highly detailed issues are more likely to be picked up because they can be prioritized and scheduled for work faster. They are also more accessible to the community, meaning that you may not have to wait for the core team to get to it. Please do not open an issue with a description that is just a link to another issue, a link to a slack conversation, a quote from either one of those, or anything else equally opaque. This raises the bar for entry and makes it hard for the community to get involved. Take the time to write a proper description and summarise key points. Take care with formatting. Ensure the markdown is tidy, use code blocks etc etc. The faster something can be read, the faster it can be dealt with. Keep it civil. Yes, it is annoying when things don’t work, but it is way more fun helping out someone who is not…​ the worst. Remember that conversing via text exacerbates everyone’s negativity bias, so throw in some emoji when in doubt. If you are here to ask for help or request some new behaviour, this is the section for you. We have curated a set of issues for anyone who simply wants to build up their open-source cred. Issues labelled good first issues should be accessible to folks new to the repos, as well as to open source in general. These issues should present a low/non-existent barrier to entry with a thorough description, easy-to-follow reproduction (if relevant) and enough context for anyone to pick up. The objective should be clear, possibly with a suggested solution or some pseudocode. If anything similar has been done, that work should be linked. If you have come across an issue tagged with good first issue which you think you would like to claim but isn’t 100% clear, please ask for more info! When people write issues there is a lot of assumed knowledge which is very often taken for granted. This is something we could all get better at, so don’t be shy in asking for what you need to do great work. See more on asking for help below! help wanted issues are for those a little more familiar with the code base, but should still be accessible enough to newcomers. All other issues labelled kind/<x> or area/<x> are also up for grabs, but are likely to require a fair amount of context. Check out the dedicated notes on getting started with development. If you need help at any stage of your work, please don’t hesitate to ask! To get more detail on the issue you have chosen, it is a good idea to start by asking whoever created it to provide more information. If you are struggling with something while working on your PR, or aren’t quite sure of your approach, you can open a draft (prefix the title with WIP:) and explain what you are thinking. Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes. Push your changes to the branch on your fork and submit a pull request to the original repository against the main branch. git push <remote-name> <feature-name> Submit a pull request. All code PR must be labeled with one of ⚠️ (:warning:, major or breaking changes) ✨ (:sparkles:, feature additions) 🐛 (:bug:, patch and bugfixes) 📖 (:book:, documentation or proposals) 🌱 (:seedling:, minor or other) Where possible, please squash your commits to ensure a tidy and descriptive history. If your PR is still a work in progress, please open a Draft PR and prefix your title with the word WIP. When your PR is ready for review, you can change the title and remove the Draft setting. We recommend that you regularly rebase from main of the original repo to keep your branch up to date. In general, we will merge a PR once a maintainer has reviewed and approved it. Trivial changes (e.g., corrections to spelling) may get waved through. For substantial changes, more people may become involved, and you might get asked to resubmit the PR or divide the changes into more than one PR. For more on how to write great commit messages, and why you should, check out this excellent blog post. We follow a rough convention for commit messages that is designed to answer three questions: what changed, why was the change made, and how did you make it. The subject line should feature the what and the body of the commit should describe the why and how. If you encountered any weirdness along the way, this is a good place to note what you discovered and how you solved it. The format can be described more formally as follows: <short title for what changed> <BLANK LINE> <why this change was made and what changed> <BLANK LINE> <any interesting details> <footer> The first line is the subject and should be no longer than 70 characters, the second line is always blank, and other lines should be wrapped at a max of 80 characters. This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools. There is a template recommend for use here. The core team regularly processes incoming issues. There may be some delay over holiday periods. Every issue will be assigned a priority/<x> label. The levels of priorities are: critical-urgent: These are time sensitive issues which should be picked up immediately. If an issue labelled critical is not assigned or being actively worked on, someone is expected to drop what they’re doing immediately to work on it. This usually means the core team, but community members are welcome to claim issues at any priority level if they get there first. However, given the pressing timeframe, should a non-core contributor request to be assigned to a critical issue, they will be paired with a core team-member to manage the tracking, communication and release of any fix as well as to assume responsibility of all progess. important-soon: Must be assigned as soon as capacity becomes available. Ideally something should be delivered in time for the next release. important-longterm: Important over the long term, but may not be currently staffed and/or may require multiple releases to complete. backlog: There appears to be general agreement that this would be good to have, but we may not have anyone available to work on it right now or in the immediate future. PRs are still very welcome, although it might take a while to get them reviewed if reviewers are fully occupied with higher priority issues, for example immediately before a release. These priority categories have been inspired by the Kubernetes contributing guide. Other labels include: adr-required: Indicates that the issue or PR contains a decision that needs to be documented in a ADR before it can be worked on. needs-investigation: There is currently insufficient information to either categorize properly, or to understand and implement a solution. This could be because the issue opener did not provide enough relevant information, or because more in-depth research is required before work can begin. The core team aims to clear the PR queue as quickly as possible. Community members should also feel free to keep an eye on things and provide their own thoughts and expertise. High-value and/or high priority contributions will be processed as quickly as possible, while lower priority or nice-to-have things may take a little longer to get approved. To help facilitate a smoother and faster review, follow the guidelines above. Submissions which do not meet standards will be de-prioritised for review. Please feel free to skip this and sub-section below, since they are only relevant to the rancher-turtles repository. Any impactful decisions to the architecture, design, development and behaviour of rancher-turtles must be recorded in the form of an ADR. A template can be found at docs/adr/0000-template.md of the repo, with numerous examples of completed records in the same directory. Contributors are also welcome to backfill ADRs if they are found to be missing. Start a new discussion using the ADR category. Choose an appropriate clear and concise title (e.g. ADR: Implement X in Go). Provide a context of the decision to be made. Describe the various options, if more than one, and explain the pros and cons. Highlight any areas which you would like the reviewers to pay attention to, or those on which you would specifically like an opinion. Tag in the maintainers as the \"Deciders\", and invite them to participate and weigh in on the decision and its consequences. Once a decision has been made, open a PR adding a new ADR to the directory. Copy and complete the template; Increment the file number by one Set the status as \"Accepted\" Set the deciders as those who approved the discussion outcome Summarise the decision and consequences from the discussion thread Link back to the discussion from the ADR doc","title":"Guidelines","component":"turtles","version":"v0.13","name":"contributing_guidelines","url":"/turtles/v0.13/en/reference/contributing_guidelines.html","titles":[{"text":"How to get involved?","hash":"_how_to_get_involved","id":1},{"text":"Opening Issues","hash":"_opening_issues","id":2},{"text":"Submitting PRs","hash":"_submitting_prs","id":3},{"text":"Choosing something to work on","hash":"_choosing_something_to_work_on","id":4},{"text":"Developing rancher-turtles","hash":"_developing_rancher_turtles","id":5},{"text":"Asking for help","hash":"_asking_for_help","id":6},{"text":"PR submission guidelines","hash":"_pr_submission_guidelines","id":7},{"text":"Commit message formatting","hash":"_commit_message_formatting","id":8},{"text":"How the Maintainers process contributions","hash":"_how_the_maintainers_process_contributions","id":9},{"text":"Prioritizing issues","hash":"_prioritizing_issues","id":10},{"text":"Reviewing PRs","hash":"_reviewing_prs","id":11},{"text":"ADRs (Architectural Decision Records)","hash":"_adrs_architectural_decision_records","id":12},{"text":"Process","hash":"_process","id":13}]},"148":{"id":148,"text":"A B C F I K M N O P R S T W Services beyond the fundamental components required to deploy a Kubernetes-conformant cluster and categorized into two types: Core Add-ons: Addons that are required to deploy a Kubernetes-conformant cluster: DNS, kube-proxy, CNI. Additional Add-ons: Addons that are not required for a Kubernetes-conformant cluster (e.g. metrics/Heapster, Dashboard). Setting up and running Kubernetes clusters without direct access to the internet. The process of turning a server into a Kubernetes node. This may involve assembling data to provide when creating the server that backs the Machine, as well as runtime configuration of the software running on that server. A temporary cluster that is used to provision a Target Management cluster. Refers to a provider that implements a solution for the bootstrap process. Core Cluster API Cluster API Provider AWS Cluster API Provider Docker Cluster API Google Cloud Provider Cluster API Operator Cluster API Provider RKE2 Cluster API Provider vSphere Cluster API Provider Azure A public API that facilitates provisioning and operations over the CAPI Operator and Cluster API resources. Term commonly used interchangeably with the workload cluster. A full Kubernetes deployment. See Management Cluster and Workload Cluster. A collection of templates that define a topology (control plane and workers) to be used to continuously reconcile one or more Clusters. See ClusterClass Or Cluster API project The Cluster API is a sub-project of the SIG-cluster-lifecycle. It is also used to refer to the software components, APIs, and community that produce them. See core provider Or Cluster API Operator project The Cluster API Operator is a sub-project of the SIG-cluster-lifecycle. It is designed to empower cluster administrators to handle the lifecycle of Cluster API providers within a management cluster using a declarative approach. Cluster API Provider RKE2 is a combination of two provider types: a Cluster API Control Plane Provider for provisioning Kubernetes control plane nodes and a Cluster API Bootstrap Provider for bootstrapping Kubernetes on a machine where RKE2 is used as the Kubernetes distro. The set of Kubernetes services that form the basis of a cluster. See also https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/#_kubernetes-control-plane There are two variants: Self-provisioned: A Kubernetes control plane consisting of pods or machines wholly managed by a single Cluster API deployment. External or Managed: A control plane offered and controlled by some system other than Cluster API (e.g., GKE, AKS, EKS, IKS). Refers to a provider that implements a solution for the management of a Kubernetes control plane. See CAPRRKE2, KCP. Refers to a provider that implements Cluster API core controllers; if you consider that the first project that must be deployed in a management Cluster is Cluster API itself, it should be clear why the Cluster API project is also referred to as the core provider. See CAPI. A container management and deployment engine designed to offer users more control on the local cluster and constant monitoring through GitOps. Take a look at fleet documentation to know more about Fleet. Refers to a provider that implements provisioning of infrastructure/computational resources required by the Cluster or by Machines (e.g. VMs, networking, etc.). Clouds infrastructure providers include AWS, Azure, or Google; while VMware, MAAS, or metal3.io can be defined as bare metal providers. Refers to a provider that allows Cluster API to interact with IPAM solutions. IPAM provider’s interaction with Cluster API is based on the IPAddressClaim and IPAddress API types. Or Kubernetes-compliant A cluster that passes the Kubernetes conformance tests. A Kubernetes Operator is a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes application. See also https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/ for more information. Refers to the main Kubernetes git repository or the main Kubernetes project. Kubeadm Control plane Provider Or Machine Resource The Custom Resource for Kubernetes that represents an infrastructure component that hosts a Kubernetes node. Perform create, scale, upgrade, or destroy operations on the cluster. Managed Kubernetes refers to any Kubernetes cluster provisioning and maintenance abstraction, usually exposed as an API, that is natively available in a Cloud provider. For example: EKS, OKE, AKS, GKE, IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, DOKS, and many more throughout the Kubernetes Cloud Native ecosystem. See Topology The cluster where one or more Infrastructure Providers run, and where resources (e.g. Machines) are stored. Typically referred to when you are provisioning multiple workload clusters. A node pool is a group of nodes within a cluster that all have the same configuration. Or OS A generically understood combination of a kernel and system-level userspace interface, such as Linux or Windows, as opposed to a particular distribution. Pivot is a process for moving the provider components and declared cluster-api resources from a Source Management cluster to a Target Management cluster. The pivot process is also used for deleting a management cluster and could also be used during an upgrade of the management cluster. Or Cluster API provider This term was originally used as abbreviation for Infrastructure provider, but currently it is used to refer to any project that can be deployed and provides functionality to the Cluster API management Cluster. See Bootstrap provider, Control plane provider, Core provider, Infrastructure provider, IPAM provider, Runtime extension provider. Refers to the YAML artifact published as part of the release process for providers; it usually includes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), Deployments (to run the controller manager), RBAC, etc. In some cases, the same expression is used to refer to the instances of above components deployed in a management cluster. See Provider repository Refers to the location where the YAML for provider components are hosted; usually a provider repository hosts many version of provider components, one for each released version. An open-source platform designed to simplify the deployment and management of Kubernetes clusters. A component deployed by Rancher in each Kubernetes cluster it manages. Its primary role is to establish a secure communication channel between the Rancher server and the Kubernetes cluster, enabling Rancher to manage and interact with the cluster. The Rancher Manager (or Rancher Server) is where the Rancher UI and API are hosted, and it communicates with managed clusters through components like the Rancher Cluster Agent. It allows users to manage their Kubernetes clusters, applications, and Rancher-specific resources such as Catalogs, Users, Global Roles, and more. Rancher’s next-generation, fully conformant Kubernetes distribution that focuses on security and compliance within the U.S. Federal Government sector. See documentation for more details. An external component which is part of a system built on top of Cluster API that can handle requests for a specific Runtime Hook. Refers to a provider that implements one or more runtime extensions. Unless otherwise specified, this refers to horizontal scaling. A control plane node where etcd is colocated with the Kubernetes API server, and is running as a static pod. The infrastructure that backs a Machine Resource, typically either a cloud instance, virtual machine, or physical host. A Kubernetes operator that provides integration between Rancher Manager and Cluster API (CAPI) with the aim of bringing full CAPI support to Rancher. A field in the Cluster object spec that allows defining and managing the shape of the Cluster’s control plane and worker machines from a single point of control. The Cluster’s topology is based on a ClusterClass. Sometimes it is also referred as a managed topology. See ClusterClass Refers to Rancher Turtles A cluster created by a ClusterAPI controller, which is not a bootstrap cluster, and is meant to be used by end-users, as opposed to by CAPI tooling. A collection of templates that define a set of worker nodes in the cluster. A ClusterClass contains zero or more WorkerClass definitions.

The specification set by SLSA is useful for both software producers and consumers: producers can follow SLSA’s guidelines to make their software supply chain more secure, and consumers can use SLSA to make decisions about whether to trust a software package. Rancher Turtles meets SLSA Level 3 requirements. Requirement Required at SLSA L3 Met by Rancher Turtles Choose an appropriate build platform Yes Yes Follow a consistent build process Yes Yes Distribute provenance Yes Yes The Rancher Turtles project uses Git for source code management. All the Rancher Turtles maintainers are required to have two-factor authentication enabled, to sign and sign off on all their contributions. The Rancher Turtles project uses GitHub Actions and GitHub Runners for building all its release artifacts. The build and release process runs in isolation on an ephemeral environment provided by GitHub-hosted runners. The build and release process is defined in code and is kept under version control. The GitHub Workflows make use of GitHub Actions pinned to certain versions and are kept up-to-date using GitHub Dependabot. All changes to the build and release process are done via Pull Requests that must be approved by at least one Rancher Turtles maintainer. The release process can only be kicked off by a Rancher Turtles maintainer by pushing a Git tag in the semver format. The Rancher Turtles project uses the official SLSA GitHub Generator project for provenance generation and distribution. The provenance for the release artifacts published to GitHub Container Registry and to Rancher Prime Registry is generated using the generator_container_slsa3 GitHub Workflow provided by the SLSA GitHub Generator project. The provenance identifies the Rancher Turtles container images using their digest in SHA-256 format. The provenance is signed by Sigstore Cosign using the GitHub OIDC identity, and the public key to verify the provenance is stored in the public Rekor transparency log. The release process and the provenance generation are run in isolation on an ephemeral environment provided by GitHub-hosted runners. The provenance of the Rancher Turtles container images can be verified using the official SLSA verifier tool. The provenance generation workflows run on ephemeral and isolated virtual machines, which are fully managed by GitHub. The provenance signing secrets are ephemeral and are generated through Sigstore’s keyless signing procedure. The SLSA GitHub Generator runs on separate virtual machines than the build and release process, so that the Rancher Turtles build scripts don’t have access to the signing secrets. The release process and the provenance generation are run in isolation on an ephemeral environment provided by GitHub-hosted runners. The provenance generation is decoupled from the build process; the SLSA GitHub Generator runs on separate virtual machines fully managed by GitHub. The release process can’t access the provenance signing key because the provenance generator runs in isolation on separate GitHub-hosted runners.","title":"SLSA","component":"turtles","version":"v0.13","name":"slsa","url":"/turtles/v0.13/en/security/slsa.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Build Platform","hash":"_build_platform","id":2},{"text":"Build Process","hash":"_build_process","id":3},{"text":"Provenance","hash":"_provenance","id":4},{"text":"Isolation","hash":"_isolation","id":5}]},"151":{"id":151,"text":"In this section we cover additional operation tasks.","title":"Introduction","component":"turtles","version":"v0.13","name":"intro","url":"/turtles/v0.13/en/tasks/intro.html","titles":[]},"152":{"id":152,"text":"This section will guide you through creating a cluster that utilizes ClusterClass using a GitOps workflow with Fleet.

ClusterClass is an experimental feature of Cluster API. As with any experimental features it should be used with caution as it may be unreliable. All experimental features are not subject to any compatibility or deprecation promise. It is planned to be graduated with CAPI v1.9. Before using ClusterClass, study the provider docs and confirm that the feature is supported. This documentation includes a matrix in the Certified providers section with cluster topology support status. To use ClusterClass it needs to be enabled for core Cluster API and any provider that supports it. This is done by setting the CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY variable to true. The Rancher Turtles Helm chart will automatically enable the feature when installing CAPI. However, when enabling additional providers, ensure CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY is set in the provider configuration. Turtles' CAPIProvider resource supports passing installation parameters to the provider via variables as follows: apiVersion: turtles-capi.cattle.io/v1alpha1 kind: CAPIProvider metadata: name: azure namespace: capz-system spec: type: infrastructure name: azure configSecret: name: azure-variables variables: CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY: \"true\" EXP_CLUSTER_RESOURCE_SET: \"true\" EXP_MACHINE_POOL: \"true\" EXP_AKS_RESOURCE_HEALTH: \"true\" The resource defined in this yaml file will install CAPZ with support for a number of features, including CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY.","title":"Introduction","component":"turtles","version":"v0.13","name":"intro","url":"/turtles/v0.13/en/getting-started/cluster-class/intro.html","titles":[{"text":"Pre-requisities","hash":"_pre_requisities","id":1}]},"154":{"id":154,"text":"This section will guide you through creating a ClusterClass which you will then use to provision a workload Cluster.

This is the base definition of the Cluster object/s that will be created from it. If the template is created optimizing flexibility, we could use it to provision workload clusters supporting variants of the same cluster shape, simplifying the configuration applied to each cluster, as the class removes most of the complexity. The template we’re using in this example will use CAPZ to provision a managed Azure (AKS) cluster. Before applying the yaml file, you will need to export the following environment variables. Remember to adapt the values to your specific scenario as these are just placeholders: export CLUSTER_CLASS_NAME=\"azure-sample\" export CLUSTER_NAME=\"azure-aks-cluster\" export AZURE_LOCATION=\"northeurope\" export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<subs-id> # you can use: az account show --query 'id' --output tsv export KUBERNETES_VERSION=\"v1.30.4\" export AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<app-id> export AZURE_TENANT_ID=<tenant-id> export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=<password> Using envsubst to substitute the exported variables in the original file. curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-turtles-fleet-example/templates/capz/cluster-template-aks-clusterclass.yaml | envsubst >> clusterclass1.yaml This will create a new yaml file clusterclass1.yaml that contains the class definition formatted with the exported values. You can study the resulting file before applying it to the cluster. kubectl apply -f clusterclass1.yaml You can validate that the class has been created successfully and inspect its content via kubectl: kubectl get clusterclasses.cluster.x-k8s.io kubectl describe clusterclasses.cluster.x-k8s.io <class-name> Now that the class resource is available in the cluster, we can go ahead and create a cluster from this topology. Let’s first substitute the variables in the template, as we did before: curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-turtles-fleet-example/templates/capz/cluster-template-aks-topology.yaml | envsubst >> cluster1.yaml This will create a new yaml file cluster1.yaml that contains the cluster definition formatted with the exported values. You can study the resulting file before applying it to the cluster, which will effectively trigger workload cluster creation. kubectl apply -f cluster1.yaml Be patient, cluster provisioning will take some time (up to 10min). While you wait for it to become ready, you can go through the capz-controller-manager logs, which is responsible for reconciling the cluster resources you just created. As with any other CAPI clusters, you will have to enable auto-import for Turtles to manage importing it into Rancher Manager. Please, refer to Mark namespace for auto-import notes to enable auto-import. The functionality provided by cluster classes makes it possible for you to deploy as many clusters as desired from the topology you created.

You can craft the YAML for your cluster manually. If you decide to do this then you can use the templates that infrastructure providers publish as part of their releases. For example, the AWS provider publishes files prefixed with cluster-template that can be used as a base.

To maintain proper resource management and avoid accidental deletion of custom resources managed outside of Helm during Helm operations, include the helm.sh/resource-policy\": keep annotation in the top-level CAPI kinds within your cluster manifests. This guide does not use ClusterClass. Templates that use ClusterClass will require that the experimental feature be enabled.

Create a file called fleet.yaml in the root and add the following contents namespace: default Commit the changes The fleet.yaml is used to specify configuration options for fleet (see docs for further details). In this instance its declaring that the cluster definitions should be added to the default namespace After the described steps there will be a repository created structure similar to the example: [https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-turtles-fleet-example] To automatically import a CAPI cluster into Rancher Manager there are 2 options: label a namespace so all clusters contained in it are imported. label an individual cluster definition so that it’s imported.

Open a terminal Label the default namespace in your Rancher Manager cluster: kubectl label namespace default cluster-api.cattle.io/rancher-auto-import=true Now the cluster definitions are committed to a git repository they can be used to provision the clusters. To do this they will need to be imported into the Rancher Manager cluster (which is also acting as a Cluster API management cluster) using the Continuous Delivery feature (which uses Fleet).

The end-to-end test environment used in Turtles provides a number of configuration alternatives depending on the type of test you are running and the type of checks you are performing. If getting started with the test suite, we recommend you keep your configuration as simple as possible and limit the number of customizations so you can understand the process and its configuration details. You can start your journey on provider testing by cloning the sample repository: git clone https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/turtles-integration-suite-example.git The simplest test execution you can run creates a local environment that does not use an internet-facing endpoint. This limits the checks to only local downstream clusters (effectively, CAPI clusters provisioned via CAPD) but it is enough to run the example integration. You can simply run this local version by specifying that you intend to run it locally. MANAGEMENT_CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT=\"isolated-kind\" make test When checking the integration with other infrastructure providers (e.g. providers for cloud vendors), you will have to make your Rancher instance available via endpoint to the downstream clusters, which are no longer in your local environment. The MANAGEMENT_CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT variable we used before, supports the following values: MANAGEMENT_CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT: \"kind\" # supported options are eks, isolated-kind, kind isolated-kind, which is the value we used for local testing, and kind will deploy equivalent local environments. The difference is that kind will also configure a publicly accessible endpoint via ngrok. You can get a free (limited) ngrok endpoint and use it for executing tests. Before running make test, you will also need to set the following environment variables: NGROK_API_KEY: \"\" NGROK_AUTHTOKEN: \"\" Using this configuration, during environment creation, the Rancher instance will be configured to be accessible via your ngrok endpoint and downstream clusters will be able to communicate with it. The Other options section contains more information on what you can configure before execution. In previous sections we introduced the main actions performed in the sample test integration: This is not a Turtles specific requirement as, when working with CAPI, there needs to be a management cluster that will be used to create resources that represent downstream clusters. This is the main part of the test environment and, depending on the environment variables passed to the test suite, it can either be hosted locally (using kind) or in the cloud (eks). Turtles is a Rancher extension and, as such, it needs a Rancher installation to be deployed. Rancher Manager will be run in the management cluster we created in the first step and the Turtles chart will be installed when Rancher is available. If using an internet-facing configuration, an ingress controller will make Rancher reachable from an outside network (e.g. cluster deployed in the cloud). The main test suite, and the one used as an example, is based on a GitOps flow and uses Fleet as a GitOps orchestrator tool. Based on the cluster templates provided (you can check the ones that come with the example integration here), it will create the CAPI clusters defined in the YAML files. Once this/these cluster/s are available, they will be configured to be imported into Rancher using Turtles and it will verify that the downstream cluster/s is/are accessible via Rancher. It will also check that deletion can be performed on downstream clusters and that they are no longer available in Rancher.

The main resource is the one representing the CAPI cluster as a Rancher cluster, so it can be viewed and managed via Rancher: clusters.provisioning.cattle.io We also call this resource a v1 cluster. If you were using Turtles before v0.9.0, the default import controller was based on generating this resource for every CAPI cluster that is imported into Rancher. The controller we will be migrating to was disabled behind a feature gate managementv3_cluster. Starting with Turtles v0.9.0, the v3 import controller is no longer behind a feature gate and represents the default import logic. This means we are moving to a different strategy for importing clusters, and switching to creating a different type of Rancher cluster resource: clusters.management.cattle.io Which you may also see referred to as v3 cluster. Migrating from one controller to the other should be transparent but you will need to prepare your already imported clusters for migration to prevent the new controller from duplicating resources. To make the migration procedure even easier, you can use the provided migration script which will let you specify the namespace where your imported clusters exist and will migrate them automatically. If you prefer, you can apply changes to resources manually per cluster via kubectl. Both cluster resources previously described are required to represent any Rancher clusters. This controller update only means that we’ll be creating one from Turtles and Rancher will take care of provisioning the other. This method provides an automated process to migrate clusters in batches per namespace. To prepare your imported CAPI clusters for migration via migration script, you need to follow the steps below: Select the namespace where your imported clusters are deployed. Pass the namespace as argument to the migration script: this will prepare ALL CAPI clusters in the namespace for migration. If you want to migrate each cluster independently, we recommend following the manual procedure. ./import_controller_migration.sh <cluster-ns> You can pass as many namespaces as arguments as you need. Before proceeding, you will be prompted for confirmation on the namespaces you provided. For each namespace, it automatically fetches v1 CAPI clusters that are not already migrated (an annotation is set on the resource after it is successfully prepared for migration). v1 clusters include a reference to v3 clusters via the status.clusterName field. Labels cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner and cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner-ns are added to v3 cluster. After successfully adding labels on v3 cluster resource, v1 cluster is annotated as migrated via cluster-api.cattle.io/migrated=true. Note that manually editing Kubernetes resources may cause unexpected failures due to wrong or missing values. If you are not confident with kubectl and interacting with the Kubernetes API and its resources, we recommend opting for the scripted migration. The requirement for migrating imported clusters is setting the labels used by the new controller on the clusters.management.cattle.io (v3) cluster resource. It is important to mark v1 clusters as migrated after adding the labels, as this is the method that prevents the new controller from duplicating Rancher cluster resources. Select the cluster/s you would like to prepare for migration. We’ll use cluster1 as an example for this guide. We can list the CAPI cluster resource clusters.cluster.x-k8s.io. We need to provide the corresponding namespace as this is a namespaced resource. kubectl get clusters.cluster.x-k8s.io -n capi-ns In our example we can see cluster1: NAMESPACE NAME PHASE AGE VERSION capi-ns cluster1 Provisioned 6d1h This CAPI cluster, when imported to Rancher, becomes linked to a Rancher cluster resource, represented by both clusters.provisioning.cattle.io and clusters.management.cattle.io. For now we’re interested in clusters.provisioning.cattle.io or v1 cluster. kubectl get clusters.provisioning.cattle.io -n capi-ns And we get the Rancher cluster that Turtles generated to represent the CAPI cluster. You can see that the -capi suffix is added to the resource name, which effectively allows us to filter CAPI clusters from all Rancher clusters (which may be provisioned using other mechanisms). NAME READY KUBECONFIG cluster1-capi v3 cluster resources are assigned a randomly generated name and we need to find the resource that is linked to the v1 cluster we retrieved in the previous step. We will do this by exploring the values of the resource, specifically status.clusterName. kubectl get clusters.provisioning.cattle.io -n capi-ns cluster1-capi -o jsonpath='{.status.clusterName}' The resource we get is c-m-xyz1a2b3, which is the one we’ll be labelling. Now that we know what resource to label, we can focus on what labels are required. These labels are used by the new controller to watch cluster resources. cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner # name of the cluster cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner-ns # name of the namespace where the cluster lives Note that the -capi suffix must be stripped when assigning cluster name to cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner Edit resource and apply labels. kubectl label clusters.management.cattle.io c-m-xyz1a2b3 cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner=cluster1 kubectl label clusters.management.cattle.io c-m-xyz1a2b3 cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner-ns=capi-ns You can now validate that the changes have been successfully applied. kubectl get clusters.management.cattle.io c-m-xyz1a2b3 -o jsonpath='{.metadata.labels}' After the clusters.management.cattle.io v3 resource has been updated, it is very important to mark the clusters.provisioning.cattle.io v1 resource as migrated, so the controller behaves as expected.

Additionally, if you are a provider developer or simply want to use a different provider that is not listed as certified, you can reuse the existing Turtles E2E suite to get started with the certification status request or simply verify that Turtles is a viable solution for you to use Rancher and CAPI together. You can read about the certification process and requirements in the Provider Certification Guide. The number of CAPI providers keeps growing and the community is coming up with new projects for different infrastructure hosts. This openness helps enrich the CAPI ecosystem but makes it impossible to control and test all providers Turtles will work with across the whole CAPI project. Developers of Turtles will maintain a list of certified providers that are actively tested and validated by CI mechanisms but this list will be limited to key and well-known providers. That is why we encourage users of providers not listed to reuse Turtles' test suite and validate the integration between the provider and Turtles. Turtles is a project that aims to be agnostic and integrate with the whole CAPI ecosystem and you are free to use it without validating any providers. Chances are you will probably find no issues with most upstream projects. As CAPI providers are projects maintained by the Kubernetes community, we cannot guarantee support for a given provider.

To simplify this task, we prepared a generic test that validates the provisioning and importing of a downstream CAPI cluster. We recommend you refer to this example on how to use Turtles' test suite. The first step in validating that your provider is compatible with Turtles and that you can provision CAPI clusters and import them into Rancher via Turtles is to integrate with our test suite. We provide a repository with an integration example that you can use as a reference for your integration. Turtles as a project contains a number of suites to verify different features and processes but, for provider certification, we require you to run only one test that uses a GitOps flow. Turtles is a project that integrates well with a GitOps approach for cluster provisioning and that is why this is our primary way of validating provider integration with Rancher. Running the full suite for a given CAPI provider will: Create a management cluster in the desired environment. Install Rancher and Turtles with all prerequisites. Install Gitea. Run the suite that will create a git repo, apply cluster template using Fleet and verify the cluster is created and successfully imported in Rancher. To successfully run the test suite, you will have to provide a number of environment variables. Some of these are agnostic, which means they are required for any provider you want to test, but others will be specific for the provider you are validating. Please, be aware of the particular specifications of the provider being tested, such as credentials, endpoints, etc. Next, we recommend you read the Test suite guide Integrating with Turtles' test suite and running checks on your provider of interest is enough to validate that it is compatible with Rancher Turtles. As it is not feasible for us to continuously test every CAPI provider, this certification workflow will allow you as a user to verify the expected functionality. However, as we are not actively testing newer iterations of the provider (with newer versions of Turtles), the support and guarantee for the given provider is limited, and you will be responsible for validating future releases. If, after successfully running checks on your provider, you would like to request it be added to the table of Certified Providers, hence being added to the project’s periodic E2E suite, you can request so via GitHub issue, using the Request for Certification template. The proposal will be studied by the community and we will decide on the feasibility of adding the provider to the certification matrix.","title":"Provider Certification Guide","component":"turtles","version":"v0.13","name":"process","url":"/turtles/v0.13/en/tasks/provider-certification/process.html","titles":[{"text":"Test & Certify your provider","hash":"_test_certify_your_provider","id":1},{"text":"Test configuration","hash":"_test_configuration","id":2},{"text":"Request for certification","hash":"_request_for_certification","id":3}]},"179":{"id":179,"text":"Starting with Turtles v0.9.0, the process used for importing CAPI clusters into Rancher is now based on a different controller logic.

This section describes how to install Cluster API Operator in the Kubernetes cluster. CAPI and desired CAPI providers could be installed using the helm-based installation for Cluster API Operator or as a helm dependency for the Rancher Turtles. To install Cluster API Operator with version 1.7.3 of the CAPI + Docker provider using helm, follow these steps: Add the Helm repository for the Cluster API Operator: helm repo add capi-operator https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/cluster-api-operator helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io Update the Helm repository: helm repo update Install the Cert-Manager: helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --namespace cert-manager --create-namespace --set installCRDs=true Install the Cluster API Operator: helm install capi-operator capi-operator/cluster-api-operator --create-namespace -n capi-operator-system --set infrastructure=docker:v1.7.3 --set core=cluster-api:v1.7.3 --timeout 90s --wait # Core Cluster API with kubeadm bootstrap and control plane providers will also be installed cert-manager is a hard requirement for CAPI and Cluster API Operator* To provide additional environment variables, enable feature gates, or supply cloud credentials, similar to clusterctl common provider, variables secret with name and a namespace of the secret could be specified for the Cluster API Operator as shown below. helm install capi-operator capi-operator/cluster-api-operator --create-namespace -n capi-operator-system --set infrastructure=docker:v1.7.3 --set core=cluster-api:v1.7.3 --timeout 90s --secret-name <secret_name> --wait Example secret data: apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: variables namespace: default type: Opaque stringData: CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY: \"true\" EXP_CLUSTER_RESOURCE_SET: \"true\" To select more than one desired provider to be installed together with the Cluster API Operator, the --infrastructure flag can be specified with multiple provider names separated by a comma. For example: helm install ... --set infrastructure=\"docker:v1.7.3;aws:v2.6.1\" The infrastructure flag is set to docker:v1.7.3;aws:v2.6.1, representing the desired provider names. This means that the Cluster API Operator will install and manage multiple providers, Docker and AWS, with versions v1.7.3 and v2.6.1 respectively. The cluster is now ready to install Rancher Turtles. The default behavior when installing the chart is to install Cluster API Operator as a Helm dependency. Since we decided to install it manually before installing Rancher Turtles, the feature cluster-api-operator.enabled must be explicitly disabled as otherwise it would conflict with the existing installation. You can refer to Install Rancher Turtles without Cluster API Operator to see next steps. For more fine-grained control of the providers and other components installed with CAPI, see the Add the infrastructure provider section. This option is only suitable for development purposes and not recommended for production environments. The rancher-turtles chart is available in https://rancher.github.io/turtles and this Helm repository must be added before proceeding with the installation: helm repo add turtles https://rancher.github.io/turtles helm repo update and then it can be installed into the rancher-turtles-system namespace with: helm install rancher-turtles turtles/rancher-turtles --version v0.12.0 -n rancher-turtles-system --set cluster-api-operator.enabled=false --set cluster-api-operator.cluster-api.enabled=false --create-namespace --wait --dependency-update As you can see, we are telling Helm to ignore installing cluster-api-operator as a dependency.","title":"Installing Cluster API Operator","component":"turtles","version":"v0.12","name":"install_capi_operator","url":"/turtles/v0.12/en/developer-guide/install_capi_operator.html","titles":[{"text":"Installing Cluster API (CAPI) and providers","hash":"_installing_cluster_api_capi_and_providers","id":1},{"text":"Install manually with Helm (alternative)","hash":"_install_manually_with_helm_alternative","id":2},{"text":"Install Rancher Turtles without Cluster API Operator as a Helm dependency","hash":"_install_rancher_turtles_without_cluster_api_operator_as_a_helm_dependency","id":3}]},"182":{"id":182,"text":"Everything you need to know about developing Rancher Turtles.","title":"Introduction","component":"turtles","version":"v0.12","name":"intro","url":"/turtles/v0.12/en/developer-guide/intro.html","titles":[]},"183":{"id":183,"text":"Rancher Turtles provides support for an air-gapped environment out-of-the-box by leveraging features of the Cluster API Operator, the required dependency for installing Rancher Turtles. To provision and configure Cluster API providers, Turtles uses the CAPIProvider resource to allow managing Cluster API Operator manifests in a declarative way. Every field provided by the upstream CAPI Operator resource for the desired spec.type is also available in the spec of the CAPIProvider resouce. To install Cluster API providers in an air-gapped environment the following will need to be done: Configure the Cluster API Operator for an air-gapped environment: The operator chart will be fetched and stored as a part of the Turtles chart. Provide image overrides for the operator from an accessible image repository. Configure Cluster API providers for an air-gapped environment: Provide fetch configuration for each provider from an accessible location (e.g., an internal github/gitlab server) or from pre-created ConfigMaps within the cluster. Provide image overrides for each provider to pull images from an accessible image repository. Configure Rancher Turtles for an air-gapped environment: Collect and publish Rancher Turtles images and publish to the private registry. Example of cert-manager installation for the reference. Provide fetch configuration and image values for core and caprke2 providers in values.yaml. Provider image value for the Cluster API Operator helm chart dependency in values.yaml. Image values specified with the cluster-api-operator key will be passed along to the Cluster API Operator. As an admin, I need to fetch the vSphere provider (CAPV) components from within the cluster because I am working in an air-gapped environment. In this example, there is a ConfigMap in the capv-system namespace that defines the components and metadata of the provider. It can be created manually or by running the following commands: # Get the file contents from the GitHub release curl -L https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-vsphere/releases/download/v1.8.5/infrastructure-components.yaml -o components.yaml curl -L https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-vsphere/releases/download/v1.8.5/metadata.yaml -o metadata.yaml # Create the configmap from the files kubectl create configmap v1.8.5 --namespace=capv-system --from-file=components=components.yaml --from-file=metadata=metadata.yaml --dry-run=client -o yaml > configmap.yaml This command example would need to be adapted to the provider and version you want to use. The resulting config map will look similar to the example below: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: labels: provider-components: vsphere name: v1.8.5 namespace: capv-system data: components: | # Components for v1.8.5 YAML go here metadata: | # Metadata information goes here A CAPIProvider resource will need to be created to represent the vSphere infrastructure provider. It will need to be configured with a fetchConfig. The label selector allows the operator to determine the available versions of the vSphere provider and the Kubernetes resources that need to be deployed (i.e. contained within ConfigMaps which match the label selector). Since the provider’s version is marked as v1.8.5, the operator uses the components information from the ConfigMap with matching label to install the vSphere provider. apiVersion: turtles-capi.cattle.io/v1alpha1 kind: CAPIProvider metadata: name: vsphere namespace: capv-system spec: name: vsphere type: infrastructure version: v1.8.5 configSecret: name: vsphere-variables fetchConfig: selector: matchLabels: provider-components: vsphere deployment: containers: - name: manager imageUrl: \"gcr.io/myregistry/capv-controller:v1.8.5-foo\" variables: CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY: \"true\" EXP_CLUSTER_RESOURCE_SET: \"true\" EXP_MACHINE_POOL: \"true\" Additionally the CAPIProvider overrides the container image to use for the provider using the deployment.containers[].imageUrl field. This allows the operator to pull the image from a registry within the air-gapped environment. There is a limit on the maximum size of a ConfigMap - 1MiB. If the manifests do not fit into this size, Kubernetes will generate an error and provider installation fail. To avoid this, you can archive the manifests and put them in the ConfigMap that way. For example, you have two files: components.yaml and metadata.yaml. To create a working config map you need: Archive components.yaml using gzip cli tool gzip -c components.yaml > components.gz Create a ConfigMap manifest from the archived data kubectl create configmap v1.8.5 --namespace=capv-system --from-file=components=components.gz --from-file=metadata=metadata.yaml --dry-run=client -o yaml > configmap.yaml Edit the file by adding \"provider.cluster.x-k8s.io/compressed: true\" annotation yq eval -i '.metadata.annotations += {\"provider.cluster.x-k8s.io/compressed\": \"true\"}' configmap.yaml without this annotation operator won’t be able to determine if the data is compressed or not. Add labels that will be used to match the ConfigMap in fetchConfig section of the provider yq eval -i '.metadata.labels += {\"my-label\": \"label-value\"}' configmap.yaml Create a ConfigMap in your kubernetes cluster using kubectl kubectl create -f configmap.yaml","title":"Air-gapped environment","component":"turtles","version":"v0.12","name":"air-gapped-environment","url":"/turtles/v0.12/en/getting-started/air-gapped-environment.html","titles":[{"text":"Example Usage","hash":"_example_usage","id":1},{"text":"Situation when manifests do not fit into ConfigMap","hash":"_situation_when_manifests_do_not_fit_into_configmap","id":2}]},"184":{"id":184,"text":"If you’re already running Rancher, you can skip this section and jump to Install Rancher Turtles.

Reading docs is often tedious, so let’s put the important contributing rule right at the top: Always be kind! Looking forward to seeing your contributions in the repo! We’d love to accept your patches in pretty much all areas of projects development! If you’re a new to the project and want to help, but don’t know where to start, here is a non-exhaustive list of ways you can help out: Submit a Pull Request Beyond fixing bugs and submitting new features, there are other things you can submit which, while less flashy, will be deeply appreciated by all who interact with the codebase: Extending test coverage! Refactoring! Reviewing and updating documentation! Adding a new UI functionality! (See also Choosing something to work on below.)

Interested in helping to improve: Rancher CAPI extension backend? Chime in on bugs or help wanted issues. If you are seeking to take on a bigger challenge or a more experienced contributor, check out feature requests. extension UI? Take a look at open or help wanted issues. maybe, user-docs? Then, jump straight into open issues in the docs repository. These guides aim to help you write issues in a way which will ensure that they are processed as quickly as possible. See below for how issues are prioritized. General rules: Before opening anything, take a good look through existing issues. More is more: give as much information as it is humanly possible to give. Highly detailed issues are more likely to be picked up because they can be prioritized and scheduled for work faster. They are also more accessible to the community, meaning that you may not have to wait for the core team to get to it. Please do not open an issue with a description that is just a link to another issue, a link to a slack conversation, a quote from either one of those, or anything else equally opaque. This raises the bar for entry and makes it hard for the community to get involved. Take the time to write a proper description and summarise key points. Take care with formatting. Ensure the markdown is tidy, use code blocks etc etc. The faster something can be read, the faster it can be dealt with. Keep it civil. Yes, it is annoying when things don’t work, but it is way more fun helping out someone who is not…​ the worst. Remember that conversing via text exacerbates everyone’s negativity bias, so throw in some emoji when in doubt. If you are here to ask for help or request some new behaviour, this is the section for you. We have curated a set of issues for anyone who simply wants to build up their open-source cred. Issues labelled good first issues should be accessible to folks new to the repos, as well as to open source in general. These issues should present a low/non-existent barrier to entry with a thorough description, easy-to-follow reproduction (if relevant) and enough context for anyone to pick up. The objective should be clear, possibly with a suggested solution or some pseudocode. If anything similar has been done, that work should be linked. If you have come across an issue tagged with good first issue which you think you would like to claim but isn’t 100% clear, please ask for more info! When people write issues there is a lot of assumed knowledge which is very often taken for granted. This is something we could all get better at, so don’t be shy in asking for what you need to do great work. See more on asking for help below! help wanted issues are for those a little more familiar with the code base, but should still be accessible enough to newcomers. All other issues labelled kind/<x> or area/<x> are also up for grabs, but are likely to require a fair amount of context. Check out the dedicated notes on getting started with development. If you need help at any stage of your work, please don’t hesitate to ask! To get more detail on the issue you have chosen, it is a good idea to start by asking whoever created it to provide more information. If you are struggling with something while working on your PR, or aren’t quite sure of your approach, you can open a draft (prefix the title with WIP:) and explain what you are thinking. Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes. Push your changes to the branch on your fork and submit a pull request to the original repository against the main branch. git push <remote-name> <feature-name> Submit a pull request. All code PR must be labeled with one of ⚠️ (:warning:, major or breaking changes) ✨ (:sparkles:, feature additions) 🐛 (:bug:, patch and bugfixes) 📖 (:book:, documentation or proposals) 🌱 (:seedling:, minor or other) Where possible, please squash your commits to ensure a tidy and descriptive history. If your PR is still a work in progress, please open a Draft PR and prefix your title with the word WIP. When your PR is ready for review, you can change the title and remove the Draft setting. We recommend that you regularly rebase from main of the original repo to keep your branch up to date. In general, we will merge a PR once a maintainer has reviewed and approved it. Trivial changes (e.g., corrections to spelling) may get waved through. For substantial changes, more people may become involved, and you might get asked to resubmit the PR or divide the changes into more than one PR. For more on how to write great commit messages, and why you should, check out this excellent blog post. We follow a rough convention for commit messages that is designed to answer three questions: what changed, why was the change made, and how did you make it. The subject line should feature the what and the body of the commit should describe the why and how. If you encountered any weirdness along the way, this is a good place to note what you discovered and how you solved it. The format can be described more formally as follows: <short title for what changed> <BLANK LINE> <why this change was made and what changed> <BLANK LINE> <any interesting details> <footer> The first line is the subject and should be no longer than 70 characters, the second line is always blank, and other lines should be wrapped at a max of 80 characters. This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools. There is a template recommend for use here. The core team regularly processes incoming issues. There may be some delay over holiday periods. Every issue will be assigned a priority/<x> label. The levels of priorities are: critical-urgent: These are time sensitive issues which should be picked up immediately. If an issue labelled critical is not assigned or being actively worked on, someone is expected to drop what they’re doing immediately to work on it. This usually means the core team, but community members are welcome to claim issues at any priority level if they get there first. However, given the pressing timeframe, should a non-core contributor request to be assigned to a critical issue, they will be paired with a core team-member to manage the tracking, communication and release of any fix as well as to assume responsibility of all progess. important-soon: Must be assigned as soon as capacity becomes available. Ideally something should be delivered in time for the next release. important-longterm: Important over the long term, but may not be currently staffed and/or may require multiple releases to complete. backlog: There appears to be general agreement that this would be good to have, but we may not have anyone available to work on it right now or in the immediate future. PRs are still very welcome, although it might take a while to get them reviewed if reviewers are fully occupied with higher priority issues, for example immediately before a release. These priority categories have been inspired by the Kubernetes contributing guide. Other labels include: adr-required: Indicates that the issue or PR contains a decision that needs to be documented in a ADR before it can be worked on. needs-investigation: There is currently insufficient information to either categorize properly, or to understand and implement a solution. This could be because the issue opener did not provide enough relevant information, or because more in-depth research is required before work can begin. The core team aims to clear the PR queue as quickly as possible. Community members should also feel free to keep an eye on things and provide their own thoughts and expertise. High-value and/or high priority contributions will be processed as quickly as possible, while lower priority or nice-to-have things may take a little longer to get approved. To help facilitate a smoother and faster review, follow the guidelines above. Submissions which do not meet standards will be de-prioritised for review. Please feel free to skip this and sub-section below, since they are only relevant to the rancher-turtles repository. Any impactful decisions to the architecture, design, development and behaviour of rancher-turtles must be recorded in the form of an ADR. A template can be found at docs/adr/0000-template.md of the repo, with numerous examples of completed records in the same directory. Contributors are also welcome to backfill ADRs if they are found to be missing. Start a new discussion using the ADR category. Choose an appropriate clear and concise title (e.g. ADR: Implement X in Go). Provide a context of the decision to be made. Describe the various options, if more than one, and explain the pros and cons.

Additional Add-ons: Addons that are not required for a Kubernetes-conformant cluster (e.g. metrics/Heapster, Dashboard). Setting up and running Kubernetes clusters without direct access to the internet. The process of turning a server into a Kubernetes node. This may involve assembling data to provide when creating the server that backs the Machine, as well as runtime configuration of the software running on that server. A temporary cluster that is used to provision a Target Management cluster. Refers to a provider that implements a solution for the bootstrap process. Core Cluster API Cluster API Provider AWS Cluster API Provider Docker Cluster API Google Cloud Provider Cluster API Operator Cluster API Provider RKE2 Cluster API Provider vSphere Cluster API Provider Azure A public API that facilitates provisioning and operations over the CAPI Operator and Cluster API resources. Term commonly used interchangeably with the workload cluster. A full Kubernetes deployment. See Management Cluster and Workload Cluster. A collection of templates that define a topology (control plane and workers) to be used to continuously reconcile one or more Clusters. See ClusterClass Or Cluster API project The Cluster API is a sub-project of the SIG-cluster-lifecycle. It is also used to refer to the software components, APIs, and community that produce them. See core provider Or Cluster API Operator project The Cluster API Operator is a sub-project of the SIG-cluster-lifecycle. It is designed to empower cluster administrators to handle the lifecycle of Cluster API providers within a management cluster using a declarative approach. Cluster API Provider RKE2 is a combination of two provider types: a Cluster API Control Plane Provider for provisioning Kubernetes control plane nodes and a Cluster API Bootstrap Provider for bootstrapping Kubernetes on a machine where RKE2 is used as the Kubernetes distro. The set of Kubernetes services that form the basis of a cluster. See also https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/#_kubernetes-control-plane There are two variants: Self-provisioned: A Kubernetes control plane consisting of pods or machines wholly managed by a single Cluster API deployment. External or Managed: A control plane offered and controlled by some system other than Cluster API (e.g., GKE, AKS, EKS, IKS). Refers to a provider that implements a solution for the management of a Kubernetes control plane. See CAPRRKE2, KCP. Refers to a provider that implements Cluster API core controllers; if you consider that the first project that must be deployed in a management Cluster is Cluster API itself, it should be clear why the Cluster API project is also referred to as the core provider. See CAPI. A container management and deployment engine designed to offer users more control on the local cluster and constant monitoring through GitOps. Take a look at fleet documentation to know more about Fleet. Refers to a provider that implements provisioning of infrastructure/computational resources required by the Cluster or by Machines (e.g. VMs, networking, etc.). Clouds infrastructure providers include AWS, Azure, or Google; while VMware, MAAS, or metal3.io can be defined as bare metal providers. Refers to a provider that allows Cluster API to interact with IPAM solutions. IPAM provider’s interaction with Cluster API is based on the IPAddressClaim and IPAddress API types. Or Kubernetes-compliant A cluster that passes the Kubernetes conformance tests. A Kubernetes Operator is a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes application. See also https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/ for more information. Refers to the main Kubernetes git repository or the main Kubernetes project. Kubeadm Control plane Provider Or Machine Resource The Custom Resource for Kubernetes that represents an infrastructure component that hosts a Kubernetes node. Perform create, scale, upgrade, or destroy operations on the cluster. Managed Kubernetes refers to any Kubernetes cluster provisioning and maintenance abstraction, usually exposed as an API, that is natively available in a Cloud provider. For example: EKS, OKE, AKS, GKE, IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, DOKS, and many more throughout the Kubernetes Cloud Native ecosystem. See Topology The cluster where one or more Infrastructure Providers run, and where resources (e.g. Machines) are stored. Typically referred to when you are provisioning multiple workload clusters. A node pool is a group of nodes within a cluster that all have the same configuration. Or OS A generically understood combination of a kernel and system-level userspace interface, such as Linux or Windows, as opposed to a particular distribution. Pivot is a process for moving the provider components and declared cluster-api resources from a Source Management cluster to a Target Management cluster. The pivot process is also used for deleting a management cluster and could also be used during an upgrade of the management cluster. Or Cluster API provider This term was originally used as abbreviation for Infrastructure provider, but currently it is used to refer to any project that can be deployed and provides functionality to the Cluster API management Cluster. See Bootstrap provider, Control plane provider, Core provider, Infrastructure provider, IPAM provider, Runtime extension provider. Refers to the YAML artifact published as part of the release process for providers; it usually includes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), Deployments (to run the controller manager), RBAC, etc. In some cases, the same expression is used to refer to the instances of above components deployed in a management cluster. See Provider repository Refers to the location where the YAML for provider components are hosted; usually a provider repository hosts many version of provider components, one for each released version. An open-source platform designed to simplify the deployment and management of Kubernetes clusters. A component deployed by Rancher in each Kubernetes cluster it manages. Its primary role is to establish a secure communication channel between the Rancher server and the Kubernetes cluster, enabling Rancher to manage and interact with the cluster. The Rancher Manager (or Rancher Server) is where the Rancher UI and API are hosted, and it communicates with managed clusters through components like the Rancher Cluster Agent. It allows users to manage their Kubernetes clusters, applications, and Rancher-specific resources such as Catalogs, Users, Global Roles, and more. Rancher’s next-generation, fully conformant Kubernetes distribution that focuses on security and compliance within the U.S. Federal Government sector. See documentation for more details. An external component which is part of a system built on top of Cluster API that can handle requests for a specific Runtime Hook. Refers to a provider that implements one or more runtime extensions. Unless otherwise specified, this refers to horizontal scaling. A control plane node where etcd is colocated with the Kubernetes API server, and is running as a static pod. The infrastructure that backs a Machine Resource, typically either a cloud instance, virtual machine, or physical host. A Kubernetes operator that provides integration between Rancher Manager and Cluster API (CAPI) with the aim of bringing full CAPI support to Rancher. A field in the Cluster object spec that allows defining and managing the shape of the Cluster’s control plane and worker machines from a single point of control. The Cluster’s topology is based on a ClusterClass. Sometimes it is also referred as a managed topology. See ClusterClass Refers to Rancher Turtles A cluster created by a ClusterAPI controller, which is not a bootstrap cluster, and is meant to be used by end-users, as opposed to by CAPI tooling. A collection of templates that define a set of worker nodes in the cluster. A ClusterClass contains zero or more WorkerClass definitions.

The specification set by SLSA is useful for both software producers and consumers: producers can follow SLSA’s guidelines to make their software supply chain more secure, and consumers can use SLSA to make decisions about whether to trust a software package. Rancher Turtles meets SLSA Level 3 requirements. Requirement Required at SLSA L3 Met by Rancher Turtles Choose an appropriate build platform Yes Yes Follow a consistent build process Yes Yes Distribute provenance Yes Yes The Rancher Turtles project uses Git for source code management. All the Rancher Turtles maintainers are required to have two-factor authentication enabled, to sign and sign off on all their contributions. The Rancher Turtles project uses GitHub Actions and GitHub Runners for building all its release artifacts. The build and release process runs in isolation on an ephemeral environment provided by GitHub-hosted runners. The build and release process is defined in code and is kept under version control. The GitHub Workflows make use of GitHub Actions pinned to certain versions and are kept up-to-date using GitHub Dependabot. All changes to the build and release process are done via Pull Requests that must be approved by at least one Rancher Turtles maintainer. The release process can only be kicked off by a Rancher Turtles maintainer by pushing a Git tag in the semver format. The Rancher Turtles project uses the official SLSA GitHub Generator project for provenance generation and distribution. The provenance for the release artifacts published to GitHub Container Registry and to Rancher Prime Registry is generated using the generator_container_slsa3 GitHub Workflow provided by the SLSA GitHub Generator project. The provenance identifies the Rancher Turtles container images using their digest in SHA-256 format. The provenance is signed by Sigstore Cosign using the GitHub OIDC identity, and the public key to verify the provenance is stored in the public Rekor transparency log. The release process and the provenance generation are run in isolation on an ephemeral environment provided by GitHub-hosted runners. The provenance of the Rancher Turtles container images can be verified using the official SLSA verifier tool. The provenance generation workflows run on ephemeral and isolated virtual machines, which are fully managed by GitHub. The provenance signing secrets are ephemeral and are generated through Sigstore’s keyless signing procedure. The SLSA GitHub Generator runs on separate virtual machines than the build and release process, so that the Rancher Turtles build scripts don’t have access to the signing secrets. The release process and the provenance generation are run in isolation on an ephemeral environment provided by GitHub-hosted runners. The provenance generation is decoupled from the build process; the SLSA GitHub Generator runs on separate virtual machines fully managed by GitHub. The release process can’t access the provenance signing key because the provenance generator runs in isolation on separate GitHub-hosted runners.","title":"SLSA","component":"turtles","version":"v0.12","name":"slsa","url":"/turtles/v0.12/en/security/slsa.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Build Platform","hash":"_build_platform","id":2},{"text":"Build Process","hash":"_build_process","id":3},{"text":"Provenance","hash":"_provenance","id":4},{"text":"Isolation","hash":"_isolation","id":5}]},"190":{"id":190,"text":"In this section we cover additional operation tasks.","title":"Introduction","component":"turtles","version":"v0.12","name":"intro","url":"/turtles/v0.12/en/tasks/intro.html","titles":[]},"191":{"id":191,"text":"This section will guide you through creating a cluster that utilizes ClusterClass using a GitOps workflow with Fleet.

Rancher Manager cluster with Rancher Turtles installed Cluster API providers installed for your scenario - we’ll be using the Docker infrastructure and RKE2 bootstrap/control plane providers in these instructions - see Initialization for common providers using Turtles' CAPIProvider clusterctl CLI - see the releases The clusterctl CLI can be used to generate the YAML for a cluster. When you run clusterctl generate cluster, it will connect to the management cluster to see what infrastructure providers have been installed. Also, it will take care of replacing any tokens in the chosen template (a.k.a flavour) with values from environment variables. Alternatively, you can craft the YAML for your cluster manually. If you decide to do this then you can use the templates that infrastructure providers publish as part of their releases. For example, the AWS provider publishes files prefixed with cluster-template that can be used as a base. You will need to replace any tokens yourself or by using clusterctl (e.g. clusterctl generate cluster test1 --from https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-aws/releases/download/v2.2.1/cluster-template-eks.yaml > cluster.yaml). To maintain proper resource management and avoid accidental deletion of custom resources managed outside of Helm during Helm operations, include the helm.sh/resource-policy\": keep annotation in the top-level CAPI kinds within your cluster manifests. This guide does not use ClusterClass. Templates that use ClusterClass will require that the experimental feature be enabled. To generate the YAML for the cluster do the following (assuming the Docker infrastructure provider is being used): Open a terminal and run the following: export CONTROL_PLANE_MACHINE_COUNT=1 export WORKER_MACHINE_COUNT=1 export KUBERNETES_VERSION=v1.30.0 clusterctl generate cluster cluster1 \\ --from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-turtles-fleet-example/templates/docker-rke2.yaml \\ > cluster1.yaml View cluster1.yaml to ensure there are no tokens.

CAPI Operator allows handling the lifecycle of Cluster API Providers using a declarative approach, extending the capabilities of clusterctl. If you want to learn more about it, you can refer to Cluster API Operator book. Before installing Rancher Turtles in your Rancher environment, Rancher’s embedded-cluster-api functionality must be disabled. This includes also cleaning up Rancher-specific webhooks that otherwise would conflict with CAPI ones. To simplify setting up Rancher for installing Rancher Turtles, the official Rancher Turtles Helm chart includes a pre-install hook that applies these changes, making it transparent to the end user: Disable the embedded-cluster-api feature in Rancher. Delete the mutating-webhook-configuration and validating-webhook-configuration webhooks that are no longer needed. If you would like to understand how Rancher Turtles works and what the architecture looks like, you can refer to the Architecture section. If uninstalling, you can refer to Uninstalling Rancher Turtles The rancher-turtles chart is available in https://rancher.github.io/turtles and this Helm repository must be added before proceeding with the installation: helm repo add turtles https://rancher.github.io/turtles helm repo update As mentioned before, installing Rancher Turtles requires the Cluster API Operator and the Helm chart can handle its installation automatically with a minimum set of flags: helm install rancher-turtles turtles/rancher-turtles --version v0.12.0 \\ -n rancher-turtles-system \\ --dependency-update \\ --create-namespace --wait \\ --timeout 180s This operation could take a few minutes and, after installing, you can take some time to study the installed controllers, including: rancher-turtles-controller. capi-operator. For a list of Rancher Turtles versions, refer to Releases page. This is the basic, recommended configuration, which manages the creation of a secret containing the required CAPI feature flags (CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY, EXP_CLUSTER_RESOURCE_SET and EXP_MACHINE_POOL enabled) in the core provider namespace.

Before installing Rancher Turtles in your Rancher environment, Rancher’s embedded-cluster-api functionality must be disabled. This includes also cleaning up Rancher-specific webhooks that otherwise would conflict with CAPI ones. To simplify setting up Rancher for installing Rancher Turtles, the official Rancher Turtles Helm chart includes a pre-install hook that applies these changes, making it transparent to the end user: Disable the embedded-cluster-api feature in Rancher. Delete the mutating-webhook-configuration and validating-webhook-configuration webhooks that are no longer needed.

The end-to-end test environment used in Turtles provides a number of configuration alternatives depending on the type of test you are running and the type of checks you are performing. If getting started with the test suite, we recommend you keep your configuration as simple as possible and limit the number of customizations so you can understand the process and its configuration details. You can start your journey on provider testing by cloning the sample repository: git clone https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/turtles-integration-suite-example.git The simplest test execution you can run creates a local environment that does not use an internet-facing endpoint. This limits the checks to only local downstream clusters (effectively, CAPI clusters provisioned via CAPD) but it is enough to run the example integration. You can simply run this local version by specifying that you intend to run it locally. MANAGEMENT_CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT=\"isolated-kind\" make test When checking the integration with other infrastructure providers (e.g. providers for cloud vendors), you will have to make your Rancher instance available via endpoint to the downstream clusters, which are no longer in your local environment. The MANAGEMENT_CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT variable we used before, supports the following values: MANAGEMENT_CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT: \"kind\" # supported options are eks, isolated-kind, kind isolated-kind, which is the value we used for local testing, and kind will deploy equivalent local environments. The difference is that kind will also configure a publicly accessible endpoint via ngrok. You can get a free (limited) ngrok endpoint and use it for executing tests. Before running make test, you will also need to set the following environment variables: NGROK_API_KEY: \"\" NGROK_AUTHTOKEN: \"\" Using this configuration, during environment creation, the Rancher instance will be configured to be accessible via your ngrok endpoint and downstream clusters will be able to communicate with it. The Other options section contains more information on what you can configure before execution. In previous sections we introduced the main actions performed in the sample test integration: This is not a Turtles specific requirement as, when working with CAPI, there needs to be a management cluster that will be used to create resources that represent downstream clusters. This is the main part of the test environment and, depending on the environment variables passed to the test suite, it can either be hosted locally (using kind) or in the cloud (eks). Turtles is a Rancher extension and, as such, it needs a Rancher installation to be deployed. Rancher Manager will be run in the management cluster we created in the first step and the Turtles chart will be installed when Rancher is available. If using an internet-facing configuration, an ingress controller will make Rancher reachable from an outside network (e.g. cluster deployed in the cloud). The main test suite, and the one used as an example, is based on a GitOps flow and uses Fleet as a GitOps orchestrator tool. Based on the cluster templates provided (you can check the ones that come with the example integration here), it will create the CAPI clusters defined in the YAML files. Once this/these cluster/s are available, they will be configured to be imported into Rancher using Turtles and it will verify that the downstream cluster/s is/are accessible via Rancher. It will also check that deletion can be performed on downstream clusters and that they are no longer available in Rancher.

The main resource is the one representing the CAPI cluster as a Rancher cluster, so it can be viewed and managed via Rancher: clusters.provisioning.cattle.io We also call this resource a v1 cluster. If you were using Turtles before v0.9.0, the default import controller was based on generating this resource for every CAPI cluster that is imported into Rancher. The controller we will be migrating to was disabled behind a feature gate managementv3_cluster. Starting with Turtles v0.9.0, the v3 import controller is no longer behind a feature gate and represents the default import logic. This means we are moving to a different strategy for importing clusters, and switching to creating a different type of Rancher cluster resource: clusters.management.cattle.io Which you may also see referred to as v3 cluster. Migrating from one controller to the other should be transparent but you will need to prepare your already imported clusters for migration to prevent the new controller from duplicating resources. To make the migration procedure even easier, you can use the provided migration script which will let you specify the namespace where your imported clusters exist and will migrate them automatically. If you prefer, you can apply changes to resources manually per cluster via kubectl. Both cluster resources previously described are required to represent any Rancher clusters. This controller update only means that we’ll be creating one from Turtles and Rancher will take care of provisioning the other. This method provides an automated process to migrate clusters in batches per namespace. To prepare your imported CAPI clusters for migration via migration script, you need to follow the steps below: Select the namespace where your imported clusters are deployed. Pass the namespace as argument to the migration script: this will prepare ALL CAPI clusters in the namespace for migration. If you want to migrate each cluster independently, we recommend following the manual procedure. ./import_controller_migration.sh <cluster-ns> You can pass as many namespaces as arguments as you need. Before proceeding, you will be prompted for confirmation on the namespaces you provided. For each namespace, it automatically fetches v1 CAPI clusters that are not already migrated (an annotation is set on the resource after it is successfully prepared for migration). v1 clusters include a reference to v3 clusters via the status.clusterName field. Labels cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner and cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner-ns are added to v3 cluster. After successfully adding labels on v3 cluster resource, v1 cluster is annotated as migrated via cluster-api.cattle.io/migrated=true. Note that manually editing Kubernetes resources may cause unexpected failures due to wrong or missing values. If you are not confident with kubectl and interacting with the Kubernetes API and its resources, we recommend opting for the scripted migration. The requirement for migrating imported clusters is setting the labels used by the new controller on the clusters.management.cattle.io (v3) cluster resource. It is important to mark v1 clusters as migrated after adding the labels, as this is the method that prevents the new controller from duplicating Rancher cluster resources. Select the cluster/s you would like to prepare for migration. We’ll use cluster1 as an example for this guide. We can list the CAPI cluster resource clusters.cluster.x-k8s.io. We need to provide the corresponding namespace as this is a namespaced resource. kubectl get clusters.cluster.x-k8s.io -n capi-ns In our example we can see cluster1: NAMESPACE NAME PHASE AGE VERSION capi-ns cluster1 Provisioned 6d1h This CAPI cluster, when imported to Rancher, becomes linked to a Rancher cluster resource, represented by both clusters.provisioning.cattle.io and clusters.management.cattle.io. For now we’re interested in clusters.provisioning.cattle.io or v1 cluster. kubectl get clusters.provisioning.cattle.io -n capi-ns And we get the Rancher cluster that Turtles generated to represent the CAPI cluster. You can see that the -capi suffix is added to the resource name, which effectively allows us to filter CAPI clusters from all Rancher clusters (which may be provisioned using other mechanisms). NAME READY KUBECONFIG cluster1-capi v3 cluster resources are assigned a randomly generated name and we need to find the resource that is linked to the v1 cluster we retrieved in the previous step. We will do this by exploring the values of the resource, specifically status.clusterName. kubectl get clusters.provisioning.cattle.io -n capi-ns cluster1-capi -o jsonpath='{.status.clusterName}' The resource we get is c-m-xyz1a2b3, which is the one we’ll be labelling. Now that we know what resource to label, we can focus on what labels are required. These labels are used by the new controller to watch cluster resources. cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner # name of the cluster cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner-ns # name of the namespace where the cluster lives Note that the -capi suffix must be stripped when assigning cluster name to cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner Edit resource and apply labels. kubectl label clusters.management.cattle.io c-m-xyz1a2b3 cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner=cluster1 kubectl label clusters.management.cattle.io c-m-xyz1a2b3 cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner-ns=capi-ns You can now validate that the changes have been successfully applied. kubectl get clusters.management.cattle.io c-m-xyz1a2b3 -o jsonpath='{.metadata.labels}' After the clusters.management.cattle.io v3 resource has been updated, it is very important to mark the clusters.provisioning.cattle.io v1 resource as migrated, so the controller behaves as expected. We do this by adding the annotation cluster-api.cattle.io/migrated kubectl annotate clusters.provisioning.cattle.io -n capi-ns cluster1-capi cluster-api.cattle.io/migrated=true","title":"Upgrade Turtles import controller","component":"turtles","version":"v0.12","name":"import_controller_upgrade","url":"/turtles/v0.12/en/tasks/maintenance/import_controller_upgrade.html","titles":[{"text":"Context","hash":"_context","id":1},{"text":"Using the migration script - per namespace","hash":"_using_the_migration_script_per_namespace","id":2},{"text":"Manually editing resources - per cluster","hash":"_manually_editing_resources_per_cluster","id":3}]},"215":{"id":215,"text":"As most CAPI providers are upstream projects maintained by the open community, there is no safe way to guarantee that any clusters provisioned with a given provider can be imported into Rancher via Turtles.

To simplify this task, we prepared a generic test that validates the provisioning and importing of a downstream CAPI cluster. We recommend you refer to this example on how to use Turtles' test suite. The first step in validating that your provider is compatible with Turtles and that you can provision CAPI clusters and import them into Rancher via Turtles is to integrate with our test suite. We provide a repository with an integration example that you can use as a reference for your integration. Turtles as a project contains a number of suites to verify different features and processes but, for provider certification, we require you to run only one test that uses a GitOps flow. Turtles is a project that integrates well with a GitOps approach for cluster provisioning and that is why this is our primary way of validating provider integration with Rancher. Running the full suite for a given CAPI provider will: Create a management cluster in the desired environment. Install Rancher and Turtles with all prerequisites. Install Gitea. Run the suite that will create a git repo, apply cluster template using Fleet and verify the cluster is created and successfully imported in Rancher. To successfully run the test suite, you will have to provide a number of environment variables. Some of these are agnostic, which means they are required for any provider you want to test, but others will be specific for the provider you are validating. Please, be aware of the particular specifications of the provider being tested, such as credentials, endpoints, etc. Next, we recommend you read the Test suite guide Integrating with Turtles' test suite and running checks on your provider of interest is enough to validate that it is compatible with Rancher Turtles. As it is not feasible for us to continuously test every CAPI provider, this certification workflow will allow you as a user to verify the expected functionality. However, as we are not actively testing newer iterations of the provider (with newer versions of Turtles), the support and guarantee for the given provider is limited, and you will be responsible for validating future releases. If, after successfully running checks on your provider, you would like to request it be added to the table of Certified Providers, hence being added to the project’s periodic E2E suite, you can request so via GitHub issue, using the Request for Certification template.

To provision and configure Cluster API providers, Turtles uses the CAPIProvider resource to allow managing Cluster API Operator manifests in a declarative way. Every field provided by the upstream CAPI Operator resource for the desired spec.type is also available in the spec of the CAPIProvider resouce. To install Cluster API providers in an air-gapped environment the following will need to be done: Configure the Cluster API Operator for an air-gapped environment: The operator chart will be fetched and stored as a part of the Turtles chart. Provide image overrides for the operator from an accessible image repository. Configure Cluster API providers for an air-gapped environment: Provide fetch configuration for each provider from an accessible location (e.g., an internal github/gitlab server) or from pre-created ConfigMaps within the cluster. Provide image overrides for each provider to pull images from an accessible image repository. Configure Rancher Turtles for an air-gapped environment: Collect and publish Rancher Turtles images and publish to the private registry. Example of cert-manager installation for the reference. Provide fetch configuration and image values for core and caprke2 providers in values.yaml. Provider image value for the Cluster API Operator helm chart dependency in values.yaml. Image values specified with the cluster-api-operator key will be passed along to the Cluster API Operator. As an admin, I need to fetch the vSphere provider (CAPV) components from within the cluster because I am working in an air-gapped environment. In this example, there is a ConfigMap in the capv-system namespace that defines the components and metadata of the provider. It can be created manually or by running the following commands: # Get the file contents from the GitHub release curl -L https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-vsphere/releases/download/v1.8.5/infrastructure-components.yaml -o components.yaml curl -L https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-vsphere/releases/download/v1.8.5/metadata.yaml -o metadata.yaml # Create the configmap from the files kubectl create configmap v1.8.5 --namespace=capv-system --from-file=components=components.yaml --from-file=metadata=metadata.yaml --dry-run=client -o yaml > configmap.yaml This command example would need to be adapted to the provider and version you want to use. The resulting config map will look similar to the example below: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: labels: provider-components: vsphere name: v1.8.5 namespace: capv-system data: components: | # Components for v1.8.5 YAML go here metadata: | # Metadata information goes here A CAPIProvider resource will need to be created to represent the vSphere infrastructure provider. It will need to be configured with a fetchConfig. The label selector allows the operator to determine the available versions of the vSphere provider and the Kubernetes resources that need to be deployed (i.e. contained within ConfigMaps which match the label selector). Since the provider’s version is marked as v1.8.5, the operator uses the components information from the ConfigMap with matching label to install the vSphere provider. apiVersion: turtles-capi.cattle.io/v1alpha1 kind: CAPIProvider metadata: name: vsphere namespace: capv-system spec: name: vsphere type: infrastructure version: v1.8.5 configSecret: name: vsphere-variables fetchConfig: selector: matchLabels: provider-components: vsphere deployment: containers: - name: manager imageUrl: \"gcr.io/myregistry/capv-controller:v1.8.5-foo\" variables: CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY: \"true\" EXP_CLUSTER_RESOURCE_SET: \"true\" EXP_MACHINE_POOL: \"true\" Additionally the CAPIProvider overrides the container image to use for the provider using the deployment.containers[].imageUrl field. This allows the operator to pull the image from a registry within the air-gapped environment. There is a limit on the maximum size of a ConfigMap - 1MiB. If the manifests do not fit into this size, Kubernetes will generate an error and provider installation fail. To avoid this, you can archive the manifests and put them in the ConfigMap that way. For example, you have two files: components.yaml and metadata.yaml. To create a working config map you need: Archive components.yaml using gzip cli tool gzip -c components.yaml > components.gz Create a ConfigMap manifest from the archived data kubectl create configmap v1.8.5 --namespace=capv-system --from-file=components=components.gz --from-file=metadata=metadata.yaml --dry-run=client -o yaml > configmap.yaml Edit the file by adding \"provider.cluster.x-k8s.io/compressed: true\" annotation yq eval -i '.metadata.annotations += {\"provider.cluster.x-k8s.io/compressed\": \"true\"}' configmap.yaml without this annotation operator won’t be able to determine if the data is compressed or not.

When installing Rancher Turtles in your Rancher environment, by default, Rancher Turtles enables the Cluster API Operator cleanup. This includes cleaning up Cluster API Operator specific webhooks and deployments that otherwise cause issues with Rancher provisioning. To simplify uninstalling Rancher Turtles (via Rancher Manager or helm command), the official Rancher Turtles Helm chart includes a post-delete hook that applies these changes, making it transparent to the end user: Delete the mutating-webhook-configuration and validating-webhook-configuration webhooks that are no longer needed. Delete the CAPI deployments that are no longer needed. To uninstall the Rancher Turtles Extension use the following helm command: helm uninstall -n rancher-turtles-system rancher-turtles --cascade foreground --wait This may take a few minutes to complete. Remember that, if you use a different name for the installation or a different namespace, you may need to customize the command for your specific configuration.

Submitting PRs Choosing something to work on Developing rancher-turtles Asking for help PR submission guidelines Commit message formatting Opening Issues How the Maintainers process contributions Prioritizing issues Reviewing PRs ADRs (Architectural Decision Records) Process Thank you for taking the time to contribute to Rancher CAPI extension projects. Improvements to all areas of the project; from code, to documentation; from bug reports to feature design and UI enhancement are gratefully welcome. This guide should cover all aspects of how to interact with the project and how to get involved in development as smoothly as possible. Reading docs is often tedious, so let’s put the important contributing rule right at the top: Always be kind! Looking forward to seeing your contributions in the repo! We’d love to accept your patches in pretty much all areas of projects development! If you’re a new to the project and want to help, but don’t know where to start, here is a non-exhaustive list of ways you can help out: Submit a Pull Request Beyond fixing bugs and submitting new features, there are other things you can submit which, while less flashy, will be deeply appreciated by all who interact with the codebase: Extending test coverage! Refactoring! Reviewing and updating documentation! Adding a new UI functionality! (See also Choosing something to work on below.) Open an issue We have 2 forms of issues: bug reports and feature requests. If you are not sure which category you need, just make the best guess and provide as much information as possible. Interested in helping to improve: Rancher CAPI extension backend? Chime in on bugs or help wanted issues. If you are seeking to take on a bigger challenge or a more experienced contributor, check out feature requests. extension UI? Take a look at open or help wanted issues. maybe, user-docs? Then, jump straight into open issues in the docs repository. These guides aim to help you write issues in a way which will ensure that they are processed as quickly as possible. See below for how issues are prioritized. General rules: Before opening anything, take a good look through existing issues. More is more: give as much information as it is humanly possible to give. Highly detailed issues are more likely to be picked up because they can be prioritized and scheduled for work faster. They are also more accessible to the community, meaning that you may not have to wait for the core team to get to it. Please do not open an issue with a description that is just a link to another issue, a link to a slack conversation, a quote from either one of those, or anything else equally opaque. This raises the bar for entry and makes it hard for the community to get involved. Take the time to write a proper description and summarise key points. Take care with formatting. Ensure the markdown is tidy, use code blocks etc etc. The faster something can be read, the faster it can be dealt with. Keep it civil. Yes, it is annoying when things don’t work, but it is way more fun helping out someone who is not…​ the worst. Remember that conversing via text exacerbates everyone’s negativity bias, so throw in some emoji when in doubt. If you are here to ask for help or request some new behaviour, this is the section for you. We have curated a set of issues for anyone who simply wants to build up their open-source cred. Issues labelled good first issues should be accessible to folks new to the repos, as well as to open source in general. These issues should present a low/non-existent barrier to entry with a thorough description, easy-to-follow reproduction (if relevant) and enough context for anyone to pick up. The objective should be clear, possibly with a suggested solution or some pseudocode. If anything similar has been done, that work should be linked. If you have come across an issue tagged with good first issue which you think you would like to claim but isn’t 100% clear, please ask for more info! When people write issues there is a lot of assumed knowledge which is very often taken for granted. This is something we could all get better at, so don’t be shy in asking for what you need to do great work. See more on asking for help below! help wanted issues are for those a little more familiar with the code base, but should still be accessible enough to newcomers. All other issues labelled kind/<x> or area/<x> are also up for grabs, but are likely to require a fair amount of context. Check out the dedicated notes on getting started with development. If you need help at any stage of your work, please don’t hesitate to ask! To get more detail on the issue you have chosen, it is a good idea to start by asking whoever created it to provide more information. If you are struggling with something while working on your PR, or aren’t quite sure of your approach, you can open a draft (prefix the title with WIP:) and explain what you are thinking. Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes. Push your changes to the branch on your fork and submit a pull request to the original repository against the main branch. git push <remote-name> <feature-name> Submit a pull request. All code PR must be labeled with one of ⚠️ (:warning:, major or breaking changes) ✨ (:sparkles:, feature additions) 🐛 (:bug:, patch and bugfixes) 📖 (:book:, documentation or proposals) 🌱 (:seedling:, minor or other) Where possible, please squash your commits to ensure a tidy and descriptive history. If your PR is still a work in progress, please open a Draft PR and prefix your title with the word WIP. When your PR is ready for review, you can change the title and remove the Draft setting. We recommend that you regularly rebase from main of the original repo to keep your branch up to date. In general, we will merge a PR once a maintainer has reviewed and approved it. Trivial changes (e.g., corrections to spelling) may get waved through. For substantial changes, more people may become involved, and you might get asked to resubmit the PR or divide the changes into more than one PR. For more on how to write great commit messages, and why you should, check out this excellent blog post. We follow a rough convention for commit messages that is designed to answer three questions: what changed, why was the change made, and how did you make it. The subject line should feature the what and the body of the commit should describe the why and how. If you encountered any weirdness along the way, this is a good place to note what you discovered and how you solved it. The format can be described more formally as follows: <short title for what changed> <BLANK LINE> <why this change was made and what changed> <BLANK LINE> <any interesting details> <footer> The first line is the subject and should be no longer than 70 characters, the second line is always blank, and other lines should be wrapped at a max of 80 characters. This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools. There is a template recommend for use here. The core team regularly processes incoming issues. There may be some delay over holiday periods. Every issue will be assigned a priority/<x> label. The levels of priorities are: critical-urgent: These are time sensitive issues which should be picked up immediately. If an issue labelled critical is not assigned or being actively worked on, someone is expected to drop what they’re doing immediately to work on it. This usually means the core team, but community members are welcome to claim issues at any priority level if they get there first. However, given the pressing timeframe, should a non-core contributor request to be assigned to a critical issue, they will be paired with a core team-member to manage the tracking, communication and release of any fix as well as to assume responsibility of all progess. important-soon: Must be assigned as soon as capacity becomes available. Ideally something should be delivered in time for the next release. important-longterm: Important over the long term, but may not be currently staffed and/or may require multiple releases to complete. backlog: There appears to be general agreement that this would be good to have, but we may not have anyone available to work on it right now or in the immediate future. PRs are still very welcome, although it might take a while to get them reviewed if reviewers are fully occupied with higher priority issues, for example immediately before a release. These priority categories have been inspired by the Kubernetes contributing guide. Other labels include: adr-required: Indicates that the issue or PR contains a decision that needs to be documented in a ADR before it can be worked on. needs-investigation: There is currently insufficient information to either categorize properly, or to understand and implement a solution. This could be because the issue opener did not provide enough relevant information, or because more in-depth research is required before work can begin. The core team aims to clear the PR queue as quickly as possible. Community members should also feel free to keep an eye on things and provide their own thoughts and expertise. High-value and/or high priority contributions will be processed as quickly as possible, while lower priority or nice-to-have things may take a little longer to get approved. To help facilitate a smoother and faster review, follow the guidelines above. Submissions which do not meet standards will be de-prioritised for review. Please feel free to skip this and sub-section below, since they are only relevant to the rancher-turtles repository. Any impactful decisions to the architecture, design, development and behaviour of rancher-turtles must be recorded in the form of an ADR. A template can be found at docs/adr/0000-template.md of the repo, with numerous examples of completed records in the same directory. Contributors are also welcome to backfill ADRs if they are found to be missing. Start a new discussion using the ADR category. Choose an appropriate clear and concise title (e.g. ADR: Implement X in Go). Provide a context of the decision to be made. Describe the various options, if more than one, and explain the pros and cons. Highlight any areas which you would like the reviewers to pay attention to, or those on which you would specifically like an opinion. Tag in the maintainers as the \"Deciders\", and invite them to participate and weigh in on the decision and its consequences. Once a decision has been made, open a PR adding a new ADR to the directory. Copy and complete the template; Increment the file number by one Set the status as \"Accepted\" Set the deciders as those who approved the discussion outcome Summarise the decision and consequences from the discussion thread Link back to the discussion from the ADR doc","title":"Guidelines","component":"turtles","version":"v0.11","name":"contributing_guidelines","url":"/turtles/v0.11/en/reference/contributing_guidelines.html","titles":[{"text":"How to get involved?","hash":"_how_to_get_involved","id":1},{"text":"Opening Issues","hash":"_opening_issues","id":2},{"text":"Submitting PRs","hash":"_submitting_prs","id":3},{"text":"Choosing something to work on","hash":"_choosing_something_to_work_on","id":4},{"text":"Developing rancher-turtles","hash":"_developing_rancher_turtles","id":5},{"text":"Asking for help","hash":"_asking_for_help","id":6},{"text":"PR submission guidelines","hash":"_pr_submission_guidelines","id":7},{"text":"Commit message formatting","hash":"_commit_message_formatting","id":8},{"text":"How the Maintainers process contributions","hash":"_how_the_maintainers_process_contributions","id":9},{"text":"Prioritizing issues","hash":"_prioritizing_issues","id":10},{"text":"Reviewing PRs","hash":"_reviewing_prs","id":11},{"text":"ADRs (Architectural Decision Records)","hash":"_adrs_architectural_decision_records","id":12},{"text":"Process","hash":"_process","id":13}]},"225":{"id":225,"text":"A B C F I K M N O P R S T W Services beyond the fundamental components required to deploy a Kubernetes-conformant cluster and categorized into two types: Core Add-ons: Addons that are required to deploy a Kubernetes-conformant cluster: DNS, kube-proxy, CNI. Additional Add-ons: Addons that are not required for a Kubernetes-conformant cluster (e.g. metrics/Heapster, Dashboard). Setting up and running Kubernetes clusters without direct access to the internet. The process of turning a server into a Kubernetes node. This may involve assembling data to provide when creating the server that backs the Machine, as well as runtime configuration of the software running on that server. A temporary cluster that is used to provision a Target Management cluster. Refers to a provider that implements a solution for the bootstrap process. Core Cluster API Cluster API Provider AWS Cluster API Provider Docker Cluster API Google Cloud Provider Cluster API Operator Cluster API Provider RKE2 Cluster API Provider vSphere Cluster API Provider Azure A public API that facilitates provisioning and operations over the CAPI Operator and Cluster API resources. Term commonly used interchangeably with the workload cluster. A full Kubernetes deployment. See Management Cluster and Workload Cluster. A collection of templates that define a topology (control plane and workers) to be used to continuously reconcile one or more Clusters. See ClusterClass Or Cluster API project The Cluster API is a sub-project of the SIG-cluster-lifecycle. It is also used to refer to the software components, APIs, and community that produce them. See core provider Or Cluster API Operator project The Cluster API Operator is a sub-project of the SIG-cluster-lifecycle. It is designed to empower cluster administrators to handle the lifecycle of Cluster API providers within a management cluster using a declarative approach. Cluster API Provider RKE2 is a combination of two provider types: a Cluster API Control Plane Provider for provisioning Kubernetes control plane nodes and a Cluster API Bootstrap Provider for bootstrapping Kubernetes on a machine where RKE2 is used as the Kubernetes distro. The set of Kubernetes services that form the basis of a cluster. See also https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/#_kubernetes-control-plane There are two variants: Self-provisioned: A Kubernetes control plane consisting of pods or machines wholly managed by a single Cluster API deployment. External or Managed: A control plane offered and controlled by some system other than Cluster API (e.g., GKE, AKS, EKS, IKS). Refers to a provider that implements a solution for the management of a Kubernetes control plane. See CAPRRKE2, KCP. Refers to a provider that implements Cluster API core controllers; if you consider that the first project that must be deployed in a management Cluster is Cluster API itself, it should be clear why the Cluster API project is also referred to as the core provider. See CAPI. A container management and deployment engine designed to offer users more control on the local cluster and constant monitoring through GitOps. Take a look at fleet documentation to know more about Fleet. Refers to a provider that implements provisioning of infrastructure/computational resources required by the Cluster or by Machines (e.g. VMs, networking, etc.). Clouds infrastructure providers include AWS, Azure, or Google; while VMware, MAAS, or metal3.io can be defined as bare metal providers. Refers to a provider that allows Cluster API to interact with IPAM solutions. IPAM provider’s interaction with Cluster API is based on the IPAddressClaim and IPAddress API types. Or Kubernetes-compliant A cluster that passes the Kubernetes conformance tests. A Kubernetes Operator is a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes application. See also https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/ for more information. Refers to the main Kubernetes git repository or the main Kubernetes project. Kubeadm Control plane Provider Or Machine Resource The Custom Resource for Kubernetes that represents an infrastructure component that hosts a Kubernetes node. Perform create, scale, upgrade, or destroy operations on the cluster. Managed Kubernetes refers to any Kubernetes cluster provisioning and maintenance abstraction, usually exposed as an API, that is natively available in a Cloud provider. For example: EKS, OKE, AKS, GKE, IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, DOKS, and many more throughout the Kubernetes Cloud Native ecosystem. See Topology The cluster where one or more Infrastructure Providers run, and where resources (e.g. Machines) are stored. Typically referred to when you are provisioning multiple workload clusters. A node pool is a group of nodes within a cluster that all have the same configuration. Or OS A generically understood combination of a kernel and system-level userspace interface, such as Linux or Windows, as opposed to a particular distribution. Pivot is a process for moving the provider components and declared cluster-api resources from a Source Management cluster to a Target Management cluster. The pivot process is also used for deleting a management cluster and could also be used during an upgrade of the management cluster. Or Cluster API provider This term was originally used as abbreviation for Infrastructure provider, but currently it is used to refer to any project that can be deployed and provides functionality to the Cluster API management Cluster. See Bootstrap provider, Control plane provider, Core provider, Infrastructure provider, IPAM provider, Runtime extension provider. Refers to the YAML artifact published as part of the release process for providers; it usually includes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), Deployments (to run the controller manager), RBAC, etc. In some cases, the same expression is used to refer to the instances of above components deployed in a management cluster. See Provider repository Refers to the location where the YAML for provider components are hosted; usually a provider repository hosts many version of provider components, one for each released version. An open-source platform designed to simplify the deployment and management of Kubernetes clusters. A component deployed by Rancher in each Kubernetes cluster it manages. Its primary role is to establish a secure communication channel between the Rancher server and the Kubernetes cluster, enabling Rancher to manage and interact with the cluster. The Rancher Manager (or Rancher Server) is where the Rancher UI and API are hosted, and it communicates with managed clusters through components like the Rancher Cluster Agent. It allows users to manage their Kubernetes clusters, applications, and Rancher-specific resources such as Catalogs, Users, Global Roles, and more. Rancher’s next-generation, fully conformant Kubernetes distribution that focuses on security and compliance within the U.S. Federal Government sector. See documentation for more details. An external component which is part of a system built on top of Cluster API that can handle requests for a specific Runtime Hook. Refers to a provider that implements one or more runtime extensions. Unless otherwise specified, this refers to horizontal scaling. A control plane node where etcd is colocated with the Kubernetes API server, and is running as a static pod. The infrastructure that backs a Machine Resource, typically either a cloud instance, virtual machine, or physical host. A Kubernetes operator that provides integration between Rancher Manager and Cluster API (CAPI) with the aim of bringing full CAPI support to Rancher. A field in the Cluster object spec that allows defining and managing the shape of the Cluster’s control plane and worker machines from a single point of control. The Cluster’s topology is based on a ClusterClass. Sometimes it is also referred as a managed topology. See ClusterClass Refers to Rancher Turtles A cluster created by a ClusterAPI controller, which is not a bootstrap cluster, and is meant to be used by end-users, as opposed to by CAPI tooling. A collection of templates that define a set of worker nodes in the cluster. A ClusterClass contains zero or more WorkerClass definitions.

The specification set by SLSA is useful for both software producers and consumers: producers can follow SLSA’s guidelines to make their software supply chain more secure, and consumers can use SLSA to make decisions about whether to trust a software package. Rancher Turtles meets SLSA Level 3 requirements. Requirement Required at SLSA L3 Met by Rancher Turtles Choose an appropriate build platform Yes Yes Follow a consistent build process Yes Yes Distribute provenance Yes Yes The Rancher Turtles project uses Git for source code management. All the Rancher Turtles maintainers are required to have two-factor authentication enabled, to sign and sign off on all their contributions. The Rancher Turtles project uses GitHub Actions and GitHub Runners for building all its release artifacts. The build and release process runs in isolation on an ephemeral environment provided by GitHub-hosted runners. The build and release process is defined in code and is kept under version control. The GitHub Workflows make use of GitHub Actions pinned to certain versions and are kept up-to-date using GitHub Dependabot. All changes to the build and release process are done via Pull Requests that must be approved by at least one Rancher Turtles maintainer. The release process can only be kicked off by a Rancher Turtles maintainer by pushing a Git tag in the semver format. The Rancher Turtles project uses the official SLSA GitHub Generator project for provenance generation and distribution. The provenance for the release artifacts published to GitHub Container Registry and to Rancher Prime Registry is generated using the generator_container_slsa3 GitHub Workflow provided by the SLSA GitHub Generator project. The provenance identifies the Rancher Turtles container images using their digest in SHA-256 format. The provenance is signed by Sigstore Cosign using the GitHub OIDC identity, and the public key to verify the provenance is stored in the public Rekor transparency log. The release process and the provenance generation are run in isolation on an ephemeral environment provided by GitHub-hosted runners. The provenance of the Rancher Turtles container images can be verified using the official SLSA verifier tool. The provenance generation workflows run on ephemeral and isolated virtual machines, which are fully managed by GitHub. The provenance signing secrets are ephemeral and are generated through Sigstore’s keyless signing procedure. The SLSA GitHub Generator runs on separate virtual machines than the build and release process, so that the Rancher Turtles build scripts don’t have access to the signing secrets. The release process and the provenance generation are run in isolation on an ephemeral environment provided by GitHub-hosted runners. The provenance generation is decoupled from the build process; the SLSA GitHub Generator runs on separate virtual machines fully managed by GitHub. The release process can’t access the provenance signing key because the provenance generator runs in isolation on separate GitHub-hosted runners.","title":"SLSA","component":"turtles","version":"v0.11","name":"slsa","url":"/turtles/v0.11/en/security/slsa.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Build Platform","hash":"_build_platform","id":2},{"text":"Build Process","hash":"_build_process","id":3},{"text":"Provenance","hash":"_provenance","id":4},{"text":"Isolation","hash":"_isolation","id":5}]},"228":{"id":228,"text":"In this section we cover additional operation tasks.","title":"Introduction","component":"turtles","version":"v0.11","name":"intro","url":"/turtles/v0.11/en/tasks/intro.html","titles":[]},"229":{"id":229,"text":"This section will guide you through creating a cluster that utilizes ClusterClass using a GitOps workflow with Fleet.

Rancher Manager cluster with Rancher Turtles installed Cluster API providers installed for your scenario - we’ll be using the Docker infrastructure and RKE2 bootstrap/control plane providers in these instructions - see Initialization for common providers using Turtles' CAPIProvider clusterctl CLI - see the releases The clusterctl CLI can be used to generate the YAML for a cluster. When you run clusterctl generate cluster, it will connect to the management cluster to see what infrastructure providers have been installed. Also, it will take care of replacing any tokens in the chosen template (a.k.a flavour) with values from environment variables. Alternatively, you can craft the YAML for your cluster manually. If you decide to do this then you can use the templates that infrastructure providers publish as part of their releases. For example, the AWS provider publishes files prefixed with cluster-template that can be used as a base. You will need to replace any tokens yourself or by using clusterctl (e.g. clusterctl generate cluster test1 --from https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-aws/releases/download/v2.2.1/cluster-template-eks.yaml > cluster.yaml). To maintain proper resource management and avoid accidental deletion of custom resources managed outside of Helm during Helm operations, include the helm.sh/resource-policy\": keep annotation in the top-level CAPI kinds within your cluster manifests. This guide does not use ClusterClass. Templates that use ClusterClass will require that the experimental feature be enabled. To generate the YAML for the cluster do the following (assuming the Docker infrastructure provider is being used): Open a terminal and run the following: export CONTROL_PLANE_MACHINE_COUNT=1 export WORKER_MACHINE_COUNT=1 export KUBERNETES_VERSION=v1.30.0 clusterctl generate cluster cluster1 \\ --from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-turtles-fleet-example/templates/docker-rke2.yaml \\ > cluster1.yaml View cluster1.yaml to ensure there are no tokens.

Create a file called fleet.yaml in the root and add the following contents namespace: default Commit the changes The fleet.yaml is used to specify configuration options for fleet (see docs for further details). In this instance its declaring that the cluster definitions should be added to the default namespace After the described steps there will be a repository created structure similar to the example: [https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-turtles-fleet-example] To automatically import a CAPI cluster into Rancher Manager there are 2 options: label a namespace so all clusters contained in it are imported. label an individual cluster definition so that it’s imported. In both cases the label is cluster-api.cattle.io/rancher-auto-import. This walkthrough will use the first option of importing all clusters in a namespace. Open a terminal Label the default namespace in your Rancher Manager cluster: kubectl label namespace default cluster-api.cattle.io/rancher-auto-import=true Now the cluster definitions are committed to a git repository they can be used to provision the clusters. To do this they will need to be imported into the Rancher Manager cluster (which is also acting as a Cluster API management cluster) using the Continuous Delivery feature (which uses Fleet).

The end-to-end test environment used in Turtles provides a number of configuration alternatives depending on the type of test you are running and the type of checks you are performing. If getting started with the test suite, we recommend you keep your configuration as simple as possible and limit the number of customizations so you can understand the process and its configuration details. You can start your journey on provider testing by cloning the sample repository: git clone https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/turtles-integration-suite-example.git The simplest test execution you can run creates a local environment that does not use an internet-facing endpoint. This limits the checks to only local downstream clusters (effectively, CAPI clusters provisioned via CAPD) but it is enough to run the example integration. You can simply run this local version by specifying that you intend to run it locally. MANAGEMENT_CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT=\"isolated-kind\" make test When checking the integration with other infrastructure providers (e.g. providers for cloud vendors), you will have to make your Rancher instance available via endpoint to the downstream clusters, which are no longer in your local environment. The MANAGEMENT_CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT variable we used before, supports the following values: MANAGEMENT_CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT: \"kind\" # supported options are eks, isolated-kind, kind isolated-kind, which is the value we used for local testing, and kind will deploy equivalent local environments. The difference is that kind will also configure a publicly accessible endpoint via ngrok. You can get a free (limited) ngrok endpoint and use it for executing tests. Before running make test, you will also need to set the following environment variables: NGROK_API_KEY: \"\" NGROK_AUTHTOKEN: \"\" Using this configuration, during environment creation, the Rancher instance will be configured to be accessible via your ngrok endpoint and downstream clusters will be able to communicate with it. The Other options section contains more information on what you can configure before execution. In previous sections we introduced the main actions performed in the sample test integration: This is not a Turtles specific requirement as, when working with CAPI, there needs to be a management cluster that will be used to create resources that represent downstream clusters. This is the main part of the test environment and, depending on the environment variables passed to the test suite, it can either be hosted locally (using kind) or in the cloud (eks). Turtles is a Rancher extension and, as such, it needs a Rancher installation to be deployed. Rancher Manager will be run in the management cluster we created in the first step and the Turtles chart will be installed when Rancher is available. If using an internet-facing configuration, an ingress controller will make Rancher reachable from an outside network (e.g. cluster deployed in the cloud). The main test suite, and the one used as an example, is based on a GitOps flow and uses Fleet as a GitOps orchestrator tool. Based on the cluster templates provided (you can check the ones that come with the example integration here), it will create the CAPI clusters defined in the YAML files. Once this/these cluster/s are available, they will be configured to be imported into Rancher using Turtles and it will verify that the downstream cluster/s is/are accessible via Rancher. It will also check that deletion can be performed on downstream clusters and that they are no longer available in Rancher.

The main resource is the one representing the CAPI cluster as a Rancher cluster, so it can be viewed and managed via Rancher: clusters.provisioning.cattle.io We also call this resource a v1 cluster. If you were using Turtles before v0.9.0, the default import controller was based on generating this resource for every CAPI cluster that is imported into Rancher. The controller we will be migrating to was disabled behind a feature gate managementv3_cluster. Starting with Turtles v0.9.0, the v3 import controller is no longer behind a feature gate and represents the default import logic. This means we are moving to a different strategy for importing clusters, and switching to creating a different type of Rancher cluster resource: clusters.management.cattle.io Which you may also see referred to as v3 cluster. Migrating from one controller to the other should be transparent but you will need to prepare your already imported clusters for migration to prevent the new controller from duplicating resources. To make the migration procedure even easier, you can use the provided migration script which will let you specify the namespace where your imported clusters exist and will migrate them automatically. If you prefer, you can apply changes to resources manually per cluster via kubectl. Both cluster resources previously described are required to represent any Rancher clusters. This controller update only means that we’ll be creating one from Turtles and Rancher will take care of provisioning the other. This method provides an automated process to migrate clusters in batches per namespace. To prepare your imported CAPI clusters for migration via migration script, you need to follow the steps below: Select the namespace where your imported clusters are deployed. Pass the namespace as argument to the migration script: this will prepare ALL CAPI clusters in the namespace for migration. If you want to migrate each cluster independently, we recommend following the manual procedure. ./import_controller_migration.sh <cluster-ns> You can pass as many namespaces as arguments as you need. Before proceeding, you will be prompted for confirmation on the namespaces you provided. For each namespace, it automatically fetches v1 CAPI clusters that are not already migrated (an annotation is set on the resource after it is successfully prepared for migration). v1 clusters include a reference to v3 clusters via the status.clusterName field. Labels cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner and cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner-ns are added to v3 cluster. After successfully adding labels on v3 cluster resource, v1 cluster is annotated as migrated via cluster-api.cattle.io/migrated=true. Note that manually editing Kubernetes resources may cause unexpected failures due to wrong or missing values. If you are not confident with kubectl and interacting with the Kubernetes API and its resources, we recommend opting for the scripted migration. The requirement for migrating imported clusters is setting the labels used by the new controller on the clusters.management.cattle.io (v3) cluster resource. It is important to mark v1 clusters as migrated after adding the labels, as this is the method that prevents the new controller from duplicating Rancher cluster resources. Select the cluster/s you would like to prepare for migration. We’ll use cluster1 as an example for this guide. We can list the CAPI cluster resource clusters.cluster.x-k8s.io. We need to provide the corresponding namespace as this is a namespaced resource. kubectl get clusters.cluster.x-k8s.io -n capi-ns In our example we can see cluster1: NAMESPACE NAME PHASE AGE VERSION capi-ns cluster1 Provisioned 6d1h This CAPI cluster, when imported to Rancher, becomes linked to a Rancher cluster resource, represented by both clusters.provisioning.cattle.io and clusters.management.cattle.io. For now we’re interested in clusters.provisioning.cattle.io or v1 cluster. kubectl get clusters.provisioning.cattle.io -n capi-ns And we get the Rancher cluster that Turtles generated to represent the CAPI cluster. You can see that the -capi suffix is added to the resource name, which effectively allows us to filter CAPI clusters from all Rancher clusters (which may be provisioned using other mechanisms). NAME READY KUBECONFIG cluster1-capi v3 cluster resources are assigned a randomly generated name and we need to find the resource that is linked to the v1 cluster we retrieved in the previous step. We will do this by exploring the values of the resource, specifically status.clusterName. kubectl get clusters.provisioning.cattle.io -n capi-ns cluster1-capi -o jsonpath='{.status.clusterName}' The resource we get is c-m-xyz1a2b3, which is the one we’ll be labelling. Now that we know what resource to label, we can focus on what labels are required. These labels are used by the new controller to watch cluster resources. cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner # name of the cluster cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner-ns # name of the namespace where the cluster lives Note that the -capi suffix must be stripped when assigning cluster name to cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner Edit resource and apply labels. kubectl label clusters.management.cattle.io c-m-xyz1a2b3 cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner=cluster1 kubectl label clusters.management.cattle.io c-m-xyz1a2b3 cluster-api.cattle.io/capi-cluster-owner-ns=capi-ns You can now validate that the changes have been successfully applied. kubectl get clusters.management.cattle.io c-m-xyz1a2b3 -o jsonpath='{.metadata.labels}' After the clusters.management.cattle.io v3 resource has been updated, it is very important to mark the clusters.provisioning.cattle.io v1 resource as migrated, so the controller behaves as expected.

The first step in validating that your provider is compatible with Turtles and that you can provision CAPI clusters and import them into Rancher via Turtles is to integrate with our test suite. We provide a repository with an integration example that you can use as a reference for your integration. Turtles as a project contains a number of suites to verify different features and processes but, for provider certification, we require you to run only one test that uses a GitOps flow. Turtles is a project that integrates well with a GitOps approach for cluster provisioning and that is why this is our primary way of validating provider integration with Rancher. Running the full suite for a given CAPI provider will: Create a management cluster in the desired environment. Install Rancher and Turtles with all prerequisites. Install Gitea. Run the suite that will create a git repo, apply cluster template using Fleet and verify the cluster is created and successfully imported in Rancher. To successfully run the test suite, you will have to provide a number of environment variables. Some of these are agnostic, which means they are required for any provider you want to test, but others will be specific for the provider you are validating. Please, be aware of the particular specifications of the provider being tested, such as credentials, endpoints, etc. Next, we recommend you read the Test suite guide Integrating with Turtles' test suite and running checks on your provider of interest is enough to validate that it is compatible with Rancher Turtles. As it is not feasible for us to continuously test every CAPI provider, this certification workflow will allow you as a user to verify the expected functionality. However, as we are not actively testing newer iterations of the provider (with newer versions of Turtles), the support and guarantee for the given provider is limited, and you will be responsible for validating future releases. If, after successfully running checks on your provider, you would like to request it be added to the table of Certified Providers, hence being added to the project’s periodic E2E suite, you can request so via GitHub issue, using the Request for Certification template.

Submitting PRs Choosing something to work on Developing rancher-turtles Asking for help PR submission guidelines Commit message formatting Opening Issues How the Maintainers process contributions Prioritizing issues Reviewing PRs ADRs (Architectural Decision Records) Process Thank you for taking the time to contribute to Rancher CAPI extension projects. Improvements to all areas of the project; from code, to documentation; from bug reports to feature design and UI enhancement are gratefully welcome. This guide should cover all aspects of how to interact with the project and how to get involved in development as smoothly as possible. Reading docs is often tedious, so let’s put the important contributing rule right at the top: Always be kind! Looking forward to seeing your contributions in the repo! We’d love to accept your patches in pretty much all areas of projects development! If you’re a new to the project and want to help, but don’t know where to start, here is a non-exhaustive list of ways you can help out: Submit a Pull Request Beyond fixing bugs and submitting new features, there are other things you can submit which, while less flashy, will be deeply appreciated by all who interact with the codebase: Extending test coverage! Refactoring! Reviewing and updating documentation! Adding a new UI functionality! (See also Choosing something to work on below.) Open an issue We have 2 forms of issues: bug reports and feature requests. If you are not sure which category you need, just make the best guess and provide as much information as possible. Interested in helping to improve: Rancher CAPI extension backend? Chime in on bugs or help wanted issues. If you are seeking to take on a bigger challenge or a more experienced contributor, check out feature requests. extension UI? Take a look at open or help wanted issues. maybe, user-docs? Then, jump straight into open issues in the docs repository. These guides aim to help you write issues in a way which will ensure that they are processed as quickly as possible. See below for how issues are prioritized. General rules: Before opening anything, take a good look through existing issues. More is more: give as much information as it is humanly possible to give. Highly detailed issues are more likely to be picked up because they can be prioritized and scheduled for work faster. They are also more accessible to the community, meaning that you may not have to wait for the core team to get to it. Please do not open an issue with a description that is just a link to another issue, a link to a slack conversation, a quote from either one of those, or anything else equally opaque. This raises the bar for entry and makes it hard for the community to get involved. Take the time to write a proper description and summarise key points. Take care with formatting. Ensure the markdown is tidy, use code blocks etc etc. The faster something can be read, the faster it can be dealt with. Keep it civil. Yes, it is annoying when things don’t work, but it is way more fun helping out someone who is not…​ the worst. Remember that conversing via text exacerbates everyone’s negativity bias, so throw in some emoji when in doubt. If you are here to ask for help or request some new behaviour, this is the section for you. We have curated a set of issues for anyone who simply wants to build up their open-source cred. Issues labelled good first issues should be accessible to folks new to the repos, as well as to open source in general. These issues should present a low/non-existent barrier to entry with a thorough description, easy-to-follow reproduction (if relevant) and enough context for anyone to pick up. The objective should be clear, possibly with a suggested solution or some pseudocode. If anything similar has been done, that work should be linked. If you have come across an issue tagged with good first issue which you think you would like to claim but isn’t 100% clear, please ask for more info! When people write issues there is a lot of assumed knowledge which is very often taken for granted. This is something we could all get better at, so don’t be shy in asking for what you need to do great work. See more on asking for help below! help wanted issues are for those a little more familiar with the code base, but should still be accessible enough to newcomers. All other issues labelled kind/<x> or area/<x> are also up for grabs, but are likely to require a fair amount of context. Check out the dedicated notes on getting started with development. If you need help at any stage of your work, please don’t hesitate to ask! To get more detail on the issue you have chosen, it is a good idea to start by asking whoever created it to provide more information. If you are struggling with something while working on your PR, or aren’t quite sure of your approach, you can open a draft (prefix the title with WIP:) and explain what you are thinking. Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes. Push your changes to the branch on your fork and submit a pull request to the original repository against the main branch. git push <remote-name> <feature-name> Submit a pull request. All code PR must be labeled with one of ⚠️ (:warning:, major or breaking changes) ✨ (:sparkles:, feature additions) 🐛 (:bug:, patch and bugfixes) 📖 (:book:, documentation or proposals) 🌱 (:seedling:, minor or other) Where possible, please squash your commits to ensure a tidy and descriptive history. If your PR is still a work in progress, please open a Draft PR and prefix your title with the word WIP. When your PR is ready for review, you can change the title and remove the Draft setting. We recommend that you regularly rebase from main of the original repo to keep your branch up to date. In general, we will merge a PR once a maintainer has reviewed and approved it. Trivial changes (e.g., corrections to spelling) may get waved through. For substantial changes, more people may become involved, and you might get asked to resubmit the PR or divide the changes into more than one PR. For more on how to write great commit messages, and why you should, check out this excellent blog post. We follow a rough convention for commit messages that is designed to answer three questions: what changed, why was the change made, and how did you make it. The subject line should feature the what and the body of the commit should describe the why and how. If you encountered any weirdness along the way, this is a good place to note what you discovered and how you solved it. The format can be described more formally as follows: <short title for what changed> <BLANK LINE> <why this change was made and what changed> <BLANK LINE> <any interesting details> <footer> The first line is the subject and should be no longer than 70 characters, the second line is always blank, and other lines should be wrapped at a max of 80 characters. This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools. There is a template recommend for use here. The core team regularly processes incoming issues. There may be some delay over holiday periods. Every issue will be assigned a priority/<x> label. The levels of priorities are: critical-urgent: These are time sensitive issues which should be picked up immediately. If an issue labelled critical is not assigned or being actively worked on, someone is expected to drop what they’re doing immediately to work on it. This usually means the core team, but community members are welcome to claim issues at any priority level if they get there first. However, given the pressing timeframe, should a non-core contributor request to be assigned to a critical issue, they will be paired with a core team-member to manage the tracking, communication and release of any fix as well as to assume responsibility of all progess. important-soon: Must be assigned as soon as capacity becomes available. Ideally something should be delivered in time for the next release. important-longterm: Important over the long term, but may not be currently staffed and/or may require multiple releases to complete. backlog: There appears to be general agreement that this would be good to have, but we may not have anyone available to work on it right now or in the immediate future. PRs are still very welcome, although it might take a while to get them reviewed if reviewers are fully occupied with higher priority issues, for example immediately before a release. These priority categories have been inspired by the Kubernetes contributing guide. Other labels include: adr-required: Indicates that the issue or PR contains a decision that needs to be documented in a ADR before it can be worked on. needs-investigation: There is currently insufficient information to either categorize properly, or to understand and implement a solution. This could be because the issue opener did not provide enough relevant information, or because more in-depth research is required before work can begin. The core team aims to clear the PR queue as quickly as possible. Community members should also feel free to keep an eye on things and provide their own thoughts and expertise. High-value and/or high priority contributions will be processed as quickly as possible, while lower priority or nice-to-have things may take a little longer to get approved. To help facilitate a smoother and faster review, follow the guidelines above. Submissions which do not meet standards will be de-prioritised for review. Please feel free to skip this and sub-section below, since they are only relevant to the rancher-turtles repository. Any impactful decisions to the architecture, design, development and behaviour of rancher-turtles must be recorded in the form of an ADR. A template can be found at docs/adr/0000-template.md of the repo, with numerous examples of completed records in the same directory. Contributors are also welcome to backfill ADRs if they are found to be missing. Start a new discussion using the ADR category. Choose an appropriate clear and concise title (e.g. ADR: Implement X in Go). Provide a context of the decision to be made. Describe the various options, if more than one, and explain the pros and cons. Highlight any areas which you would like the reviewers to pay attention to, or those on which you would specifically like an opinion. Tag in the maintainers as the \"Deciders\", and invite them to participate and weigh in on the decision and its consequences. Once a decision has been made, open a PR adding a new ADR to the directory. Copy and complete the template; Increment the file number by one Set the status as \"Accepted\" Set the deciders as those who approved the discussion outcome Summarise the decision and consequences from the discussion thread Link back to the discussion from the ADR doc","title":"Guidelines","component":"turtles","version":"next","name":"guidelines","url":"/turtles/next/en/developer/guidelines.html","titles":[{"text":"How to get involved?","hash":"_how_to_get_involved","id":1},{"text":"Opening Issues","hash":"_opening_issues","id":2},{"text":"Submitting PRs","hash":"_submitting_prs","id":3},{"text":"Choosing something to work on","hash":"_choosing_something_to_work_on","id":4},{"text":"Developing rancher-turtles","hash":"_developing_rancher_turtles","id":5},{"text":"Asking for help","hash":"_asking_for_help","id":6},{"text":"PR submission guidelines","hash":"_pr_submission_guidelines","id":7},{"text":"Commit message formatting","hash":"_commit_message_formatting","id":8},{"text":"How the Maintainers process contributions","hash":"_how_the_maintainers_process_contributions","id":9},{"text":"Prioritizing issues","hash":"_prioritizing_issues","id":10},{"text":"Reviewing PRs","hash":"_reviewing_prs","id":11},{"text":"ADRs (Architectural Decision Records)","hash":"_adrs_architectural_decision_records","id":12},{"text":"Process","hash":"_process","id":13}]},"258":{"id":258,"text":"Rancher Turtles provides support for an air-gapped environment out-of-the-box by leveraging features of the Cluster API Operator, the required dependency for installing Rancher Turtles. To provision and configure Cluster API providers, Turtles uses the CAPIProvider resource to allow managing Cluster API Operator manifests in a declarative way. Every field provided by the upstream CAPI Operator resource for the desired spec.type is also available in the spec of the CAPIProvider resouce. To install Cluster API providers in an air-gapped environment the following will need to be done: Configure the Cluster API Operator for an air-gapped environment: The operator chart will be fetched and stored as a part of the Turtles chart. Provide image overrides for the operator from an accessible image repository. Configure Cluster API providers for an air-gapped environment: Provide fetch configuration for each provider from an accessible location (e.g., an internal github/gitlab server) or from pre-created ConfigMaps within the cluster. Provide image overrides for each provider to pull images from an accessible image repository. Configure Rancher Turtles for an air-gapped environment: Collect and publish Rancher Turtles images and publish to the private registry. Example of cert-manager installation for the reference. Provide fetch configuration and image values for core and caprke2 providers in values.yaml. Provider image value for the Cluster API Operator helm chart dependency in values.yaml. Image values specified with the cluster-api-operator key will be passed along to the Cluster API Operator. As an admin, I need to fetch the vSphere provider (CAPV) components from within the cluster because I am working in an air-gapped environment. In this example, there is a ConfigMap in the capv-system namespace that defines the components and metadata of the provider. It can be created manually or by running the following commands: # Get the file contents from the GitHub release curl -L https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/cluster-api-provider-vsphere/releases/download/v1.11.2/infrastructure-components.yaml -o components.yaml curl -L https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/cluster-api-provider-vsphere/releases/download/v1.11.2/metadata.yaml -o metadata.yaml # Create the configmap from the files kubectl create configmap v1.11.2 --namespace=capv-system --from-file=components=components.yaml --from-file=metadata=metadata.yaml --dry-run=client -o yaml > configmap.yaml This command example would need to be adapted to the provider and version you want to use. The resulting config map will look similar to the example below: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: labels: provider-components: vsphere name: v1.11.2 namespace: capv-system data: components: | # Components for v1.11.2 YAML go here metadata: | # Metadata information goes here A CAPIProvider resource will need to be created to represent the vSphere infrastructure provider. It will need to be configured with a fetchConfig. The label selector allows the operator to determine the available versions of the vSphere provider and the Kubernetes resources that need to be deployed (i.e. contained within ConfigMaps which match the label selector). Since the provider’s version is marked as v1.11.2, the operator uses the components information from the ConfigMap with matching label to install the vSphere provider. apiVersion: turtles-capi.cattle.io/v1alpha1 kind: CAPIProvider metadata: name: vsphere namespace: capv-system spec: name: vsphere type: infrastructure version: v1.11.2 configSecret: name: vsphere-variables fetchConfig: selector: matchLabels: provider-components: vsphere deployment: containers: - name: manager imageUrl: \"registry.suse.com/rancher/cluster-api-vsphere-controller:v1.11.2\" variables: CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY: \"true\" EXP_CLUSTER_RESOURCE_SET: \"true\" EXP_MACHINE_POOL: \"true\" Additionally the CAPIProvider overrides the container image to use for the provider using the deployment.containers[].imageUrl field. This allows the operator to pull the image from a registry within the air-gapped environment. There is a limit on the maximum size of a ConfigMap - 1MiB. If the manifests do not fit into this size, Kubernetes will generate an error and provider installation fail. To avoid this, you can archive the manifests and put them in the ConfigMap that way. For example, you have two files: components.yaml and metadata.yaml. To create a working config map you need: Archive components.yaml using gzip cli tool gzip -c components.yaml > components.gz Create a ConfigMap manifest from the archived data kubectl create configmap v1.11.2 --namespace=capv-system --from-file=components=components.gz --from-file=metadata=metadata.yaml --dry-run=client -o yaml > configmap.yaml Edit the file by adding \"provider.cluster.x-k8s.io/compressed: true\" annotation yq eval -i '.metadata.annotations += {\"provider.cluster.x-k8s.io/compressed\": \"true\"}' configmap.yaml without this annotation operator won’t be able to determine if the data is compressed or not. Add labels that will be used to match the ConfigMap in fetchConfig section of the provider yq eval -i '.metadata.labels += {\"my-label\": \"label-value\"}' configmap.yaml Create a ConfigMap in your kubernetes cluster using kubectl kubectl create -f configmap.yaml","title":"Air-gapped environment","component":"turtles","version":"next","name":"airgapped","url":"/turtles/next/en/operator/airgapped.html","titles":[{"text":"Example Usage","hash":"_example_usage","id":1},{"text":"Situation when manifests do not fit into ConfigMap","hash":"_situation_when_manifests_do_not_fit_into_configmap","id":2}]},"259":{"id":259,"text":"The CAPIProvider resource allows managing Cluster API Operator manifests in a declarative way. It is used to provision and configure Cluster API providers like AWS, vSphere etc. CAPIProvider follows a GitOps model - the spec fields are declarative user inputs. The controller only updates status. Every field provided by the upstream CAPI Operator resource for the desired spec.type is also available in the spec of the CAPIProvider resouce. Feel free to refer to upstream configuration guides for advanced scenarios. To use the CAPIProvider resource: Create a CAPIProvider resource with the desired provider name, type, credentials, configuration, and features. The CAPIProvider controller will handle templating the required Cluster API Operator manifests based on the CAPIProvider spec. The status field on the CAPIProvider resource will reflect the state of the generated manifests. Manage the CAPIProvider object declaratively to apply changes to the generated provider manifests. Here is an example CAPIProvider manifest: apiVersion: turtles-capi.cattle.io/v1alpha1 kind: CAPIProvider metadata: name: aws-infra namespace: capi-providers spec: name: aws type: infrastructure credentials: rancherCloudCredential: aws-creds # Rancher credentials secret for AWS configSecret: name: aws-config features: clusterResourceSet: true This will generate an AWS infrastructure provider with the supplied mapping for rancher credential secret and custom enabled features.

However, we do implement a certification process for those providers that: Are actively tested as part of our E2E suites. These tests are kept up-to-date to validate recent versions of the provider. Satisfy the prerequisites in the certification process. Additionally, if you are a provider developer or simply want to use a different provider that is not listed as certified, you can reuse the existing Turtles E2E suite to get started with the certification status request or simply verify that Turtles is a viable solution for you to use Rancher and CAPI together. You can read about the certification process and requirements in the Provider Certification Guide. The number of CAPI providers keeps growing and the community is coming up with new projects for different infrastructure hosts. This openness helps enrich the CAPI ecosystem but makes it impossible to control and test all providers Turtles will work with across the whole CAPI project. Developers of Turtles will maintain a list of certified providers that are actively tested and validated by CI mechanisms but this list will be limited to key and well-known providers. That is why we encourage users of providers not listed to reuse Turtles' test suite and validate the integration between the provider and Turtles. Turtles is a project that aims to be agnostic and integrate with the whole CAPI ecosystem and you are free to use it without validating any providers. Chances are you will probably find no issues with most upstream projects. As CAPI providers are projects maintained by the Kubernetes community, we cannot guarantee support for a given provider. This is why we opt for focusing on constant validation of Certified Providers and offer users the possibility of integrating with the existing test suite to verify their providers of choice. The process of certification is based on verifying Rancher Turtles integration with CAPI providers. To simplify this task, we prepared a generic test that validates the provisioning and importing of a downstream CAPI cluster. We recommend you refer to this example on how to use Turtles' test suite. The first step in validating that your provider is compatible with Turtles and that you can provision CAPI clusters and import them into Rancher via Turtles is to integrate with our test suite. We provide a repository with an integration example that you can use as a reference for your integration. Turtles as a project contains a number of suites to verify different features and processes but, for provider certification, we require you to run only one test that uses a GitOps flow. Turtles is a project that integrates well with a GitOps approach for cluster provisioning and that is why this is our primary way of validating provider integration with Rancher. Running the full suite for a given CAPI provider will: Create a management cluster in the desired environment. Install Rancher and Turtles with all prerequisites. Install Gitea. Run the suite that will create a git repo, apply cluster template using Fleet and verify the cluster is created and successfully imported in Rancher. To successfully run the test suite, you will have to provide a number of environment variables. Some of these are agnostic, which means they are required for any provider you want to test, but others will be specific for the provider you are validating. Please, be aware of the particular specifications of the provider being tested, such as credentials, endpoints, etc. Next, we recommend you read the Test suite guide Integrating with Turtles' test suite and running checks on your provider of interest is enough to validate that it is compatible with Rancher Turtles. As it is not feasible for us to continuously test every CAPI provider, this certification workflow will allow you as a user to verify the expected functionality. However, as we are not actively testing newer iterations of the provider (with newer versions of Turtles), the support and guarantee for the given provider is limited, and you will be responsible for validating future releases. If, after successfully running checks on your provider, you would like to request it be added to the table of Certified Providers, hence being added to the project’s periodic E2E suite, you can request so via GitHub issue, using the Request for Certification template. The proposal will be studied by the community and we will decide on the feasibility of adding the provider to the certification matrix.","title":"Certification","component":"turtles","version":"next","name":"certification","url":"/turtles/next/en/operator/certification.html","titles":[{"text":"What is a Certified Provider?","hash":"_what_is_a_certified_provider","id":1},{"text":"Certify Your Custom Provider","hash":"_certify_your_custom_provider","id":2},{"text":"Why would I want to validate my provider?","hash":"_why_would_i_want_to_validate_my_provider","id":3},{"text":"Can I use Turtles with an uncertified provider?","hash":"_can_i_use_turtles_with_an_uncertified_provider","id":4},{"text":"What is the difference between certified and supported?","hash":"_what_is_the_difference_between_certified_and_supported","id":5},{"text":"Provider Certification Guide","hash":"_provider_certification_guide","id":6},{"text":"Test & Certify Your Provider","hash":"_test_certify_your_provider","id":7},{"text":"Test Configuration","hash":"_test_configuration","id":8},{"text":"Request for Certification","hash":"_request_for_certification","id":9}]},"261":{"id":261,"text":"For the up-to-date content of values.yaml source file, refer to the Rancher Turtles repository.

If you would like to understand how Rancher Turtles works and what the architecture looks like, you can refer to the Architecture section. If uninstalling, you can refer to Uninstalling Rancher Turtles The rancher-turtles chart is available in https://rancher.github.io/turtles and this Helm repository must be added before proceeding with the installation: helm repo add turtles https://rancher.github.io/turtles helm repo update As mentioned before, installing Rancher Turtles requires the Cluster API Operator and the Helm chart can handle its installation automatically with a minimum set of flags: helm install rancher-turtles turtles/rancher-turtles --version v0.16.0 \\ -n rancher-turtles-system \\ --dependency-update \\ --create-namespace --wait \\ --timeout 180s This operation could take a few minutes and, after installing, you can take some time to study the installed controllers, including: rancher-turtles-controller. capi-operator. This is the basic, recommended configuration, which manages the creation of a secret containing the required CAPI feature flags (CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY, EXP_CLUSTER_RESOURCE_SET and EXP_MACHINE_POOL enabled) in the core provider namespace. These feature flags are required to enable additional Cluster API functionality. If you need to override the default behavior and use an existing secret (or add custom environment variables), you can pass the secret name helm flag. In this case, as a user, you are in charge of managing the secret creation and its content, including the minimum required features: CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY, EXP_CLUSTER_RESOURCE_SET and EXP_MACHINE_POOL enabled. helm install ... # Passing secret name and namespace for additional environment variables --set cluster-api-operator.cluster-api.configSecret.name=<secret_name> The following is an example of a user-managed secret cluster-api-operator.cluster-api.configSecret.name=variables with CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY, EXP_CLUSTER_RESOURCE_SET and EXP_MACHINE_POOL feature flags set and an extra custom variable: secret.yaml apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: variables namespace: rancher-turtles-system type: Opaque stringData: CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY: \"true\" EXP_CLUSTER_RESOURCE_SET: \"true\" EXP_MACHINE_POOL: \"true\" CUSTOM_ENV_VAR: \"false\" For detailed information on the values supported by the chart and their usage, refer to Helm chart options","title":"Via Helm install","component":"turtles","version":"next","name":"manual","url":"/turtles/next/en/operator/manual.html","titles":[{"text":"Install Rancher Turtles with Cluster API Operator as a Helm dependency","hash":"_install_rancher_turtles_with_cluster_api_operator_as_a_helm_dependency","id":1}]},"264":{"id":264,"text":"This section contains information on how you can leverage the existing E2E suite to integrate any CAPI providers with Turtles and verify that the provisioning and importing of clusters works as expected. The validation performs the following actions: Create a management cluster in the desired environment. Install Rancher and Turtles with all prerequisites. Install Gitea. Run the suite that will create a git repo, apply cluster template using Fleet and verify the cluster is created and successfully imported in Rancher. The test suite can be used for certification of providers not listed in the Certification table, as detailed in Provider Certification. The main reference for reusing the test suite is this repository, which contains an example on how to integrate a given CAPI provider with Rancher Turtles and applies a series of checks based on a GitOps workflow. The end-to-end test environment used in Turtles provides a number of configuration alternatives depending on the type of test you are running and the type of checks you are performing. If getting started with the test suite, we recommend you keep your configuration as simple as possible and limit the number of customizations so you can understand the process and its configuration details. You can start your journey on provider testing by cloning the sample repository: git clone https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/turtles-integration-suite-example.git The simplest test execution you can run creates a local environment that does not use an internet-facing endpoint. This limits the checks to only local downstream clusters (effectively, CAPI clusters provisioned via CAPD) but it is enough to run the example integration. You can simply run this local version by specifying that you intend to run it locally. MANAGEMENT_CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT=\"isolated-kind\" make test When checking the integration with other infrastructure providers (e.g. providers for cloud vendors), you will have to make your Rancher instance available via endpoint to the downstream clusters, which are no longer in your local environment. The MANAGEMENT_CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT variable we used before, supports the following values: MANAGEMENT_CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT: \"kind\" # supported options are eks, isolated-kind, kind isolated-kind, which is the value we used for local testing, and kind will deploy equivalent local environments. The difference is that kind will also configure a publicly accessible endpoint via ngrok. You can get a free (limited) ngrok endpoint and use it for executing tests. Before running make test, you will also need to set the following environment variables: NGROK_API_KEY: \"\" NGROK_AUTHTOKEN: \"\" Using this configuration, during environment creation, the Rancher instance will be configured to be accessible via your ngrok endpoint and downstream clusters will be able to communicate with it. The Other options section contains more information on what you can configure before execution. In previous sections we introduced the main actions performed in the sample test integration: This is not a Turtles specific requirement as, when working with CAPI, there needs to be a management cluster that will be used to create resources that represent downstream clusters. This is the main part of the test environment and, depending on the environment variables passed to the test suite, it can either be hosted locally (using kind) or in the cloud (eks). Turtles is a Rancher extension and, as such, it needs a Rancher installation to be deployed. Rancher Manager will be run in the management cluster we created in the first step and the Turtles chart will be installed when Rancher is available. If using an internet-facing configuration, an ingress controller will make Rancher reachable from an outside network (e.g. cluster deployed in the cloud). The main test suite, and the one used as an example, is based on a GitOps flow and uses Fleet as a GitOps orchestrator tool. Based on the cluster templates provided (you can check the ones that come with the example integration here), it will create the CAPI clusters defined in the YAML files. Once this/these cluster/s are available, they will be configured to be imported into Rancher using Turtles and it will verify that the downstream cluster/s is/are accessible via Rancher. It will also check that deletion can be performed on downstream clusters and that they are no longer available in Rancher. You can take a look at the config.yaml file in the turtles-integration-suite-example repository, which contains a list of environment variables used during test environment deployment and test execution.

A Rancher User will use Rancher to manage clusters. Rancher will be able to use Cluster API to manage the lifecycle of child Kubernetes clusters. Below is a visual representation of the architecture components of Rancher Turtles. This diagram illustrates the key elements and their relationships within the Rancher Turtles system. Understanding these components is essential for gaining insights into how Rancher leverages Cluster API (CAPI) for cluster management. This is the core component of Rancher and users can leverage the existing Explorer feature in the dashboard to access cluster workload details. The agent is deployed within child clusters, enabling Rancher to import and establish a connection with these clusters. This connection allows Rancher to manage the child clusters effectively from within its platform. It provides integration between CAPI and Rancher while currently supporting the following functionalities: Importing CAPI clusters into Rancher: installing Rancher Cluster Agent in CAPI provisioned clusters. CAPI Operator Configuration: Configuration support for the CAPI Operator. This is the only topology currently supported, where both Rancher Manager and Rancher Turtles are deployed to the same Kubernetes cluster, and it acts as a centralized management cluster. This architecture offers a simplified deployment of components and provides a single view of all clusters. On the flip side, it’s important to consider that the number of clusters that can be managed effectively by Cluster API (CAPI) is limited by the resources available within the single management cluster.","title":"Architecture","component":"turtles","version":"next","name":"architecture","url":"/turtles/next/en/reference/architecture.html","titles":[{"text":"Components","hash":"_components","id":1},{"text":"Rancher Manager","hash":"_rancher_manager","id":2},{"text":"Rancher Cluster Agent","hash":"_rancher_cluster_agent","id":3},{"text":"Rancher Turtles - Rancher CAPI Extension","hash":"_rancher_turtles_rancher_capi_extension","id":4},{"text":"Deployment Topology","hash":"_deployment_topology","id":5},{"text":"Rancher Manager & CAPI Management Combined","hash":"_rancher_manager_capi_management_combined","id":6}]},"266":{"id":266,"text":"Certified Providers are CAPI Providers that are actively tested by the Turtles team’s CI workflows to validate they work properly with the CAPI extension for Rancher.

Core Cluster API Cluster API Provider AWS Cluster API Provider Docker Cluster API Google Cloud Provider Cluster API Operator Cluster API Provider RKE2 Cluster API Provider vSphere Cluster API Provider Azure A public API that facilitates provisioning and operations over the CAPI Operator and Cluster API resources. Term commonly used interchangeably with the workload cluster. A full Kubernetes deployment. See Management Cluster and Workload Cluster. A collection of templates that define a topology (control plane and workers) to be used to continuously reconcile one or more Clusters. See ClusterClass Or Cluster API project The Cluster API is a sub-project of the SIG-cluster-lifecycle. It is also used to refer to the software components, APIs, and community that produce them. See core provider Or Cluster API Operator project The Cluster API Operator is a sub-project of the SIG-cluster-lifecycle. It is designed to empower cluster administrators to handle the lifecycle of Cluster API providers within a management cluster using a declarative approach. Cluster API Provider RKE2 is a combination of two provider types: a Cluster API Control Plane Provider for provisioning Kubernetes control plane nodes and a Cluster API Bootstrap Provider for bootstrapping Kubernetes on a machine where RKE2 is used as the Kubernetes distro. The set of Kubernetes services that form the basis of a cluster. See also https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/#_kubernetes-control-plane There are two variants: Self-provisioned: A Kubernetes control plane consisting of pods or machines wholly managed by a single Cluster API deployment. External or Managed: A control plane offered and controlled by some system other than Cluster API (e.g., GKE, AKS, EKS, IKS). Refers to a provider that implements a solution for the management of a Kubernetes control plane. See CAPRRKE2, KCP. Refers to a provider that implements Cluster API core controllers; if you consider that the first project that must be deployed in a management Cluster is Cluster API itself, it should be clear why the Cluster API project is also referred to as the core provider. See CAPI. A container management and deployment engine designed to offer users more control on the local cluster and constant monitoring through GitOps. Take a look at fleet documentation to know more about Fleet. Refers to a provider that implements provisioning of infrastructure/computational resources required by the Cluster or by Machines (e.g. VMs, networking, etc.). Clouds infrastructure providers include AWS, Azure, or Google; while VMware, MAAS, or metal3.io can be defined as bare metal providers. Refers to a provider that allows Cluster API to interact with IPAM solutions. IPAM provider’s interaction with Cluster API is based on the IPAddressClaim and IPAddress API types.

Kubeadm Control plane Provider Or Machine Resource The Custom Resource for Kubernetes that represents an infrastructure component that hosts a Kubernetes node. Perform create, scale, upgrade, or destroy operations on the cluster. Managed Kubernetes refers to any Kubernetes cluster provisioning and maintenance abstraction, usually exposed as an API, that is natively available in a Cloud provider. For example: EKS, OKE, AKS, GKE, IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, DOKS, and many more throughout the Kubernetes Cloud Native ecosystem. See Topology The cluster where one or more Infrastructure Providers run, and where resources (e.g. Machines) are stored. Typically referred to when you are provisioning multiple workload clusters. A node pool is a group of nodes within a cluster that all have the same configuration. Or OS A generically understood combination of a kernel and system-level userspace interface, such as Linux or Windows, as opposed to a particular distribution. Pivot is a process for moving the provider components and declared cluster-api resources from a Source Management cluster to a Target Management cluster. The pivot process is also used for deleting a management cluster and could also be used during an upgrade of the management cluster. Or Cluster API provider This term was originally used as abbreviation for Infrastructure provider, but currently it is used to refer to any project that can be deployed and provides functionality to the Cluster API management Cluster. See Bootstrap provider, Control plane provider, Core provider, Infrastructure provider, IPAM provider, Runtime extension provider. Refers to the YAML artifact published as part of the release process for providers; it usually includes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), Deployments (to run the controller manager), RBAC, etc. In some cases, the same expression is used to refer to the instances of above components deployed in a management cluster. See Provider repository Refers to the location where the YAML for provider components are hosted; usually a provider repository hosts many version of provider components, one for each released version. An open-source platform designed to simplify the deployment and management of Kubernetes clusters. A component deployed by Rancher in each Kubernetes cluster it manages. Its primary role is to establish a secure communication channel between the Rancher server and the Kubernetes cluster, enabling Rancher to manage and interact with the cluster. The Rancher Manager (or Rancher Server) is where the Rancher UI and API are hosted, and it communicates with managed clusters through components like the Rancher Cluster Agent. It allows users to manage their Kubernetes clusters, applications, and Rancher-specific resources such as Catalogs, Users, Global Roles, and more. Rancher’s next-generation, fully conformant Kubernetes distribution that focuses on security and compliance within the U.S. Federal Government sector. See documentation for more details. An external component which is part of a system built on top of Cluster API that can handle requests for a specific Runtime Hook. Refers to a provider that implements one or more runtime extensions.

Rancher Turtles meets SLSA Level 3 requirements. Requirement Required at SLSA L3 Met by Rancher Turtles Choose an appropriate build platform Yes Yes Follow a consistent build process Yes Yes Distribute provenance Yes Yes The Rancher Turtles project uses Git for source code management. All the Rancher Turtles maintainers are required to have two-factor authentication enabled, to sign and sign off on all their contributions. The Rancher Turtles project uses GitHub Actions and GitHub Runners for building all its release artifacts. The build and release process runs in isolation on an ephemeral environment provided by GitHub-hosted runners. The build and release process is defined in code and is kept under version control. The GitHub Workflows make use of GitHub Actions pinned to certain versions and are kept up-to-date using GitHub Dependabot. All changes to the build and release process are done via Pull Requests that must be approved by at least one Rancher Turtles maintainer. The release process can only be kicked off by a Rancher Turtles maintainer by pushing a Git tag in the semver format. The Rancher Turtles project uses the official SLSA GitHub Generator project for provenance generation and distribution. The provenance for the release artifacts published to GitHub Container Registry and to Rancher Prime Registry is generated using the generator_container_slsa3 GitHub Workflow provided by the SLSA GitHub Generator project. The provenance identifies the Rancher Turtles container images using their digest in SHA-256 format. The provenance is signed by Sigstore Cosign using the GitHub OIDC identity, and the public key to verify the provenance is stored in the public Rekor transparency log. The release process and the provenance generation are run in isolation on an ephemeral environment provided by GitHub-hosted runners. The provenance of the Rancher Turtles container images can be verified using the official SLSA verifier tool. The provenance generation workflows run on ephemeral and isolated virtual machines, which are fully managed by GitHub. The provenance signing secrets are ephemeral and are generated through Sigstore’s keyless signing procedure. The SLSA GitHub Generator runs on separate virtual machines than the build and release process, so that the Rancher Turtles build scripts don’t have access to the signing secrets. The release process and the provenance generation are run in isolation on an ephemeral environment provided by GitHub-hosted runners. The provenance generation is decoupled from the build process; the SLSA GitHub Generator runs on separate virtual machines fully managed by GitHub. The release process can’t access the provenance signing key because the provenance generator runs in isolation on separate GitHub-hosted runners.","title":"SLSA","component":"turtles","version":"next","name":"slsa","url":"/turtles/next/en/security/slsa.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Build Platform","hash":"_build_platform","id":2},{"text":"Build Process","hash":"_build_process","id":3},{"text":"Provenance","hash":"_provenance","id":4},{"text":"Isolation","hash":"_isolation","id":5}]},"271":{"id":271,"text":"This section will guide you through creating your first cluster and importing it into Rancher Manager.

This walkthrough will use the first option of importing all clusters in a namespace. Open a terminal Label the cluster’s namespace in your Rancher Manager cluster: kubectl label namespace capi-clusters cluster-api.cattle.io/rancher-auto-import=true A namespace (or cluster) can be marked for auto-import at any time: before or after the cluster has been created.","title":"Create & Import Your First Cluster","component":"turtles","version":"next","name":"first-cluster","url":"/turtles/next/en/tutorials/first-cluster.html","titles":[{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"_prerequisites","id":1},{"text":"Provision a CAPI Workload Cluster","hash":"_provision_a_capi_workload_cluster","id":2},{"text":"Mark Namespace for auto-import","hash":"_mark_namespace_for_auto_import","id":3}]},"272":{"id":272,"text":"Rancher Turtles is a Rancher extension which means that you must have Rancher installed before you can get started with Rancher Turtles. If you don’t have Rancher installed yet, make sure to follow one of the official installation guides. We recommend you take a look at the Prerequisites table to determine the appropriate version to install. Before you can install Rancher Turtles, you need to have the following components installed: Name Version Details Kubernetes cluster v1.30.0 Helm v3.12.0 Follow the official installation docs Rancher v2.10.0 Using helm based installation on any kubernetes cluster directly or on a newly created Amazon, Azure or Google service based options. Cert-manager v1.15.2 Using helm based installation or via kubectl apply. This table lists the version of the components installed with the latest version v0.16.0 of Rancher Turtles: If you’re customizing the installation parameters, please make sure that you are using compatible versions of the components. Name Version Cluster API Operator v0.16.0 Cluster API v1.9.4 Cluster API Provider RKE2 v0.11.0 This is the recommended option for installing Rancher Turtles. Via Rancher UI, and just by adding the Turtles repository, we can easily let Rancher take care of the installation and configuration of the Cluster API Extension. Installing Rancher Turtles will transform your Rancher Manager cluster into a CAPI Management cluster so you can provision and manage CAPI workload clusters. Rancher’s embedded-cluster-api functionality will be disabled when installing Rancher Turtles. This includes also cleaning up Rancher-specific webhooks that otherwise would conflict with CAPI ones. The recommended way to disable this feature and the Rancher-specific webhooks, is to use the official Rancher Turtles Helm chart, that includes a pre-install hook to apply the following changes: Disable the embedded-cluster-api feature in Rancher. Delete the mutating-webhook-configuration and validating-webhook-configuration webhooks that are no longer needed. From your browser, access Rancher Manager and explore the local cluster. Using the left navigation panel, go to Apps -> Repositories. Click Create to add a new repository. Enter the following: Name: turtles. Index URL: https://rancher.github.io/turtles. Wait for the turtles repository to have a status of Active. Go to Apps -> Charts. Filter for turtles. Click Rancher Turtles - the Cluster API Extension Click Install -> Next -> Install. Rancher will select not to install Turtles into a Project by default. Installing Turtles into a Project is not supported and the default configuration None should be used to avoid unexpected behavior during installation. This will use the default values for the Helm chart, which are good for most installations. If your configuration requires overriding some of these defaults, you can either specify the values during installation from Rancher UI or, alternatively, you can opt for the manual installation via Helm. And, if you are interested on learning more about the available values, you can check the reference guide. The installation may take a few minutes and, when it finishes, you will be able to see the following new deployments in the cluster: rancher-turtles-system/rancher-turtles-controller-manager rancher-turtles-system/rancher-turtles-cluster-api-operator capi-system/capi-controller-manager rke2-bootstrap-system/rke2-bootstrap-controller-manager rke2-control-plane-system/rke2-control-plane-controller-manager Rancher also provides a UI extension that makes it easy to manage CAPI providers, create CAPI clusters and view CAPI related resources via the Rancher Dashboard. Installing the CAPI UI extension is similar to installing Turtles. Installing Turtles prior to installing the CAPI UI extension is recommended. From your browser, access Rancher Manager and navigate to the Extensions page. Using the three dots menu located at the top right, select Manage Repositories. This should open the Repositories page for the local cluster. Click Create to add a new repository. Enter the following: Name: capi-ui. Target: http(s) URL to an index generated by Helm Index URL: https://rancher.github.io/capi-ui-extension. Click Create. Wait for the capi-ui repository to have a status of Active. Go to Extensions -> Available. Find the CAPI UI card and click on its Install button. Select the version to install (default is the latest) and click Install. Once the extension is installed, click on the Reload button at the top of the page to reload the page. The CAPI UI extension is now installed. You can navigate to Cluster Management -> CAPI to start using it.","title":"Install","component":"turtles","version":"next","name":"quickstart","url":"/turtles/next/en/tutorials/quickstart.html","titles":[{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"_prerequisites","id":1},{"text":"Components Versions","hash":"_components_versions","id":2},{"text":"Via Rancher Dashboard","hash":"_via_rancher_dashboard","id":3},{"text":"Installation","hash":"_installation","id":4},{"text":"CAPI UI extension installation","hash":"_capi_ui_extension_installation","id":5}]},"273":{"id":273,"text":"If you’re already running Rancher, you can skip this section and jump to Install Rancher Turtles.

Applications can be automatically deployed to the created cluster using GitOps. The provider will automatically create a Fleet ClusterGroup for every CAPI ClusterClass in the ClusterClass namespace. This enables you to deploy the same applications to all clusters created from the same ClusterClass.

Additionally, users can leverage the upstream CAPI ecosystem and benefit from the many existing infrastructure providers that enable users to provision clusters on many infrastructure provider targets. Cluster API is released as an Extension for Rancher, allowing that traditional provisioning and cluster-api can be used side by side. That makes it a great fit not just for greenfield projects, as well existing rancher manager users can benefit. Ranchers Cluster API extension is initially released as part of our early adopter program, enabling close collaboration with our customers, shaping jointly a mature solution that is battle proven. We are aiming to bring early Q1 Cluster API into GA and production support. If you are interested in joining our Early Adopter Program for Cluster API , don't hesitate to reach out.

v0.16.0 This release of Rancher Turtles focuses on: Updating Cluster API (CAPI) to v1.9+ . Enhancing the build process by introducing cross-compilation to build multi-architecture images. Fixing bugs and adding minor enhancements related to the experimental feature etcd snapshot and restore, Helm chart deprecated values, and support to use CA certificates stored in Rancher to import clusters using the agent TLS settings. All imported CAPI clusters are now represented by the v3 clusters.management.cattle.io resource (if clusters were imported before this change was introduced, they're now automatically migrated). This completes the migration described in ADR 10. Boosting the development process: streamlining Tilt configuration, and adding more tests while also optimizing the test environment setup. General cleanup: Removing deprecated features and updating various dependencies. Addon Provider Fleet is now enabled by default: you can use Fleet to manage CAPI clusters.
